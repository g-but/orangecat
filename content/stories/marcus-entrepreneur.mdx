Traditional banks wouldn't lend to me without collateral. Local investors wanted equity I wasn't willing to give up. That's when I discovered OrangeCat.

I created a detailed business plan showing how solar panels would reduce energy costs for families by 70% while eliminating harmful kerosene fumes. I posted photos of the communities I'd serve and explained the environmental impact.

People from around the world sent Bitcoin. A software engineer in San Francisco sent $500. A climate activist in Sweden contributed $200. Local business owners in Nairobi pooled $300.

In 3 months, I exceeded my goal. I've now installed systems in 5 homes, each saving $30/month on energy. Those families are my marketing—word spreads fast when people see real impact. I'm already planning my second round of expansion.

## Why OrangeCat?

> Bitcoin and OrangeCat made global funding possible. People from 8 countries supported my local business. The blockchain transparency meant I could prove every panel installation.
