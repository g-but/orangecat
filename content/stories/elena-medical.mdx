My research into early-onset Parkinson's treatment was showing promising results, but I needed $15,000 for specialized lab equipment to accelerate trials. Grant applications take 18 months—patients don't have that time.

I turned to OrangeCat because I could maintain research independence. No corporate sponsors influencing my work, no giving up intellectual property rights.

I created a project explaining the science in plain language: how this equipment would let me test protein interactions 10x faster. I shared my published papers, university credentials, and preliminary results. I made a video showing exactly what the equipment does.

The Bitcoin community responded. Many supporters had family members with Parkinson's and understood the urgency. Others were scientists who believed in open, independent research.

I provided weekly updates. Photos of the equipment being delivered. Videos explaining new test results. Blockchain-verifiable records of how funds were spent.

We exceeded our goal and advanced our research timeline by 6 months. Three peer-reviewed papers are now in submission. Most importantly, we're closer to a treatment that could help millions—funded by people who believed in open science.

## Why OrangeCat?

> Grant funding takes 18 months. OrangeCat let me raise funds in 4 months while maintaining research independence. No corporate strings attached, just people who believe in open science.
