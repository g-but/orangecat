I needed $2,000 for art supplies and studio rent. Instead of begging on social media, I posted my project. People sent Bitcoin—$10, $50, $100—directly to my wallet.

I shared every purchase. Photos of canvases with store receipts. Screenshots of studio rent payment. A video of my new workspace.

In 2 weeks I had enough. The Bitcoin address was public, so anyone could verify I wasn't lying about amounts. When I spent funds, they could see it move on the blockchain.

I didn't just fundraise—I built relationships. I shared works-in-progress. Supporters saw their $20 donation become actual art. Three supporters became collectors. Two introduced me to gallery owners.

## Key Results

- Created 8 new paintings for exhibition
- 3 paintings sold to collectors
- Secured studio space for 6 months
- Built a community of 23 supporters

## Why OrangeCat?

> OrangeCat let me show supporters exactly where every dollar went. The transparency built trust, and people who donated small amounts early sent more when they saw I was accountable.
