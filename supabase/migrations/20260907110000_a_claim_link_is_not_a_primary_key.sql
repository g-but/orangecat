-- A claim link is not a primary key, and "no" is a state.
--
-- ADR-0004 D4 and the consent half of the problem statement.
--
-- 1. TOKEN. `profile_claims.id` currently doubles as the claim credential:
--    `/claim/<id>` is the link you send. That was a reasonable trade (122 bits,
--    no extra column), but it means the row can never be named in public,
--    because its public name is its password. Every plausible next step needs a
--    public reference that is not the credential — a greyed `@karl` chip for
--    someone who has not joined, an unclaimed placeholder page, a share card.
--
--    Splitting them is a ONE-WAY DOOR. Today `profile_claims` has zero
--    production rows, so this is one migration. After the first real claim it
--    is this migration plus rotating every link already sent to a human being.
--    That is the entire reason it is done now rather than when it is needed.
--
-- 2. DECLINED. `status` was pending|claimed|revoked. `revoked` is the CREATOR
--    withdrawing the link; there was no state for the RECIPIENT saying no —
--    the one state consent actually requires. Without it, "Karl doesn't want
--    this" and "Karl hasn't looked yet" are the same row, so the product
--    cannot stop nudging him, and cannot prove it was asked to stop.
--
-- 3. DELIVERY + MATERIALISATION. `delivered_at`/`delivered_channel`,
--    `first_viewed_at`/`view_count` make the funnel measurable (created → sent
--    → opened → claimed); `materialized` is the resume ledger for D3, recording
--    what a claim has already created so a partial claim resumes instead of
--    unwinding.
