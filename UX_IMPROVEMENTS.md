# UX Improvements: Profile Editing Flow

## Problem Identified

The original implementation had poor UX with confusing information architecture:

### Issues Fixed:
1. **React Hooks Error**: "Rendered fewer hooks than expected" due to early returns before hooks
2. **Duplicate Profile Editing**: Two places to edit profile (Settings tab + Profile page)
3. **Poor Information Architecture**: Users had to think about where to find things
4. **Over-Engineering**: Unnecessary tabs and complexity for simple tasks

## Solution Implemented

### Clear Separation of Concerns

**Profile Editing (`/profile`)**
- ✅ Dedicated page for profile information
- ✅ Avatar upload
- ✅ Username, display name, bio
- ✅ Website and social links
- ✅ Bitcoin & Lightning addresses
- ✅ Clear, task-oriented design

**Account Settings (`/settings`)**
- ✅ Email address management
- ✅ Password changes
- ✅ Account security
- ✅ Account deletion (danger zone)

### UX Principles Applied

1. **Don't Make Users Think**: Clear, obvious navigation
2. **Task-Oriented Design**: Organized by what users want to accomplish
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each page has one clear purpose
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: No unnecessary tabs or decisions

### Technical Improvements

1. **Fixed React Hooks**: Moved early returns after all hooks are declared
2. **Proper State Management**: Following auth state management rules
3. **Consistent Error Handling**: Better user feedback
4. **Clean Code**: Removed duplicate functionality

## User Flow

```
User wants to edit profile → Goes to "Edit Profile" → Updates profile info
User wants to change email → Goes to "Settings" → Updates account settings
```

This is much more intuitive than the previous tab-based approach where users had to think about which tab their desired action belonged to.

## Result

- ✅ No more React errors
- ✅ Clear, intuitive navigation
- ✅ Faster task completion
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Cleaner codebase
