---

## Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Terminology (2-3 hours, Day 1)

- Unify "campaign" → "project" everywhere
- Update types, stores, services, components
- Single commit

### Phase 2: Services (3-4 hours, Day 1-2)

- Consolidate profile services (delete 2, merge 1)
- Update all imports
- Test profile operations

### Phase 3: Components (2-3 hours, Day 2)

- Consolidate 3 card components into 1
- Update component exports
- Test dashboard and pages

### Phase 4: API Routes (4-5 hours, Day 3-4)

- Standardize error handling pattern
- Consolidate duplicate routes
- Update rate limiting approach

### Phase 5: Code Cleanup (2-3 hours, Day 4-5)

- Remove deprecated functions
- Complete or remove TODO items
- Delete unused code

### Phase 6: Utility Consolidation (1-2 hours, Day 5)

- Merge 5 error handlers into 1
- Consolidate validation systems
- Merge configuration files
