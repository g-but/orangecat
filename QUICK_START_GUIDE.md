# üöÄ Quick Start Guide - Intelligent Onboarding & Organization Creation

## Backend Flow (What's Actually Happening)

### Database Operations

When you create an organization:

```
1. User submits form
   ‚Üì
2. API validates authentication
   ‚Üì
3. Generate unique slug
   ‚Üì
4. INSERT into `organizations` table
   ‚Üì
5. INSERT into `memberships` table (you as owner)
   ‚Üì
6. RLS policies enforce access control
   ‚Üì
7. Data saved to Supabase
   ‚Üì
8. Frontend shows success
   ‚Üì
9. Redirect to organization page
```

### What Gets Stored

**Organizations Table:**
- ID, name, slug, description, type
- Website URL, Bitcoin treasury address
- Governance model, public visibility
- Created/updated timestamps

**Memberships Table:**
- Organization ID, User ID
- Role (owner, admin, moderator, member, guest)
- Full permissions JSON
- Status (active, inactive, suspended, banned)
