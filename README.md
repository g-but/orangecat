## The Problem

Economic participation still requires gatekeepers. To sell, fund, lend, invest, or govern collectively, you need banks, payment processors, platforms that take cuts and dictate terms. Pseudonymous participation is impossible. AI agents can't transact on your behalf.

## The Solution

OrangeCat is an AI-native platform for universal economic participation. The live wedge is a Bitcoin Lightning pay link. "My Cat" — an AI agent across exchanging, funding, lending, investing, and governing — is **roadmap**, not what ships today.

- **Any identity**: Human, pseudonymous, or AI — all are first-class economic participants
- **Bitcoin now, broader rails later**: Lightning and on-chain Bitcoin are the only live settlement rails. Fiat and privacy rails remain roadmap work because they do not provide the same shared public audit trail.
- **Full economic spectrum (roadmap beyond the pay link)**: From gifts (no strings) to loans (some strings) to investments (more strings)
- **Private where needed, transparent where chosen**: E2E encrypted messaging, on-chain transparency when appropriate

## What Works Today

- **Pay link (the wedge)**: every user gets `orangecat.ch/pay/<username>` for Bitcoin Lightning payments.
- **Live site**: [orangecat.ch](https://orangecat.ch)
- **Shipped surfaces**: product/service listings, groups, events, documents, and related entity types exist on the live site. Funding, lending, and investing sit on the roadmap.
- **FleetCrown dogfood**: FleetCrown (live at [fleetcrown.orangecat.ch](https://fleetcrown.orangecat.ch)) uses OrangeCat as a sibling product — typed stakeholder edges, shared BTC wallet, profiles as projects. Sibling-product integration: typed stakeholder edges, shared BTC wallet, profiles as projects.

## Roadmap

- **Funding**: account-free Bitcoin support for public projects
- **Lending**: peer-to-peer loans with repayment tracking
- **Investing**: investment flows beyond the pay-link wedge
- **The Cat**: AI agent that manages economic activity across the full spectrum

## Architecture

13 entity types, one registry. One ownership model (actors), one permission layer (database RLS). Adding a new entity type requires 2-3 files.

<summary><strong>Technical details</strong></summary>

### Entity Registry Pattern

`src/config/entity-registry.ts` — single source of truth for all 13 entity types. Drives CRUD, navigation, forms, and validation. No entity-specific switch statements.

### Actor System

Users and groups both have actors. All entities reference `actor_id`. One ownership model, one permission check — works for individuals, organizations, and (future) AI agents.

### Middleware Composition

```typescript
export default compose(withAuth(), withRateLimit('write'), withValidation(schema))(handler);
```

Functional composition replaces inheritance. Each middleware does one thing.

### Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) at the database level — bugs in app code can't bypass authorization
- Zod schemas as SSOT — TypeScript types derived from schemas, never separate
- Structured API responses across all 40+ routes

<details>
<summary><strong>Quick Start</strong></summary>

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A Supabase project (remote — no local Docker needed)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitbaum/orangecat.git
cd orangecat
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in Supabase credentials
npm run dev
```

Dev server starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for the full list. Key variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` — Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — Server-side Supabase key

## Project Structure

```
src/
  config/entity-registry.ts  -- SSOT: all 13 entity types
  lib/api/                    -- Middleware composition, generic CRUD
  domain/                     -- Business logic (no HTTP, no UI)
  services/                   -- Currency, search, notifications, groups
  features/                   -- Messaging, auth
  app/api/                    -- API routes (thin, composed from middleware)
  components/                 -- UI components (shadcn/ui based)
```

## Testing

2648 unit tests across 282 files (CI as of 2026-09-02). Pre-push hooks run type-check, lint, and the full test suite before any code reaches the remote.
