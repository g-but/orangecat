/**
 * POST /api/cat/offers-from-text  — body: { text }
 *
 * The deterministic "paste who you are → get monetizable offerings" seam.
 * Every part of this already existed but only fired reactively inside a chat
 * turn: the onboarding box just seeded a Cat conversation and hoped the model
 * called suggest_offers. This chains the built pieces synchronously —
 * persist the bio, extract the economic profile, and reason over it — so a
 * pasted bio comes back as concrete, typed offers the user can create in one
 * click.
 *
 * Reuses: generateOffers (offer-engine.ts) for the grounded proposals — the
 * pasted text is persisted as the bio AND passed as `focus`, so offers are
 * grounded in it either way. Returns [] on thin input / model failure — the UI
 * degrades to "talk to your Cat instead".
