/**
 * GET /api/cron/payment-reconcile — converge OrangeCat's record of money with
 * reality, without depending on anyone's browser being open.
 *
 * OrangeCat is non-custodial: the invoice belongs to the recipient's wallet, so
 * the truth about a payment lives at their provider or on the chain. Our
 * `payment_intents` row is a cache of someone else's fact, and caches must be
 * reconciled — nothing pushes settlement to us.
 *
 * Until this existed, the only thing that ever asked was the payer's open tab.
 * Pay, close the tab, and the sats landed while our record stayed
 * `invoice_ready` forever: the recipient never got their notification, and for
 * entity funding no contribution row was written, so the totals stayed at zero.
 *
 * This is a BACKSTOP, not the primary path — the browser's 3s poll still covers
 * the common case. It therefore optimises for certainty, not latency: run every
 * minute, take a bounded batch, ask the same detection path the browser uses.
