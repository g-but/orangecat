/**
 * Persisting a message, with authorization already decided elsewhere.
 *
 * Extracted from `sendMessage`, which does two separable things: it decides
 * whether the caller may speak as `senderId` — requiring a signed-in user whose
 * id matches — and then it writes. Those are different concerns, and conflating
 * them meant there was no way for a sender that is not a browser session to
 * write at all.
 *
 * The Cat is exactly that sender. It answers from a cron worker with no session,
 * so calling `sendMessage` threw `Unauthorized` and its reply was lost — found
 * by running the real path against production, not by any unit test, because a
 * mocked client has no opinion about sessions.
 *
 * The fix is NOT to relax `sendMessage`. Its "sender must match the
 * authenticated user" check is a real control on the human path and stays
 * exactly as it was; it now delegates the writing half to this. A caller
 * reaching this function is asserting that authorization has already happened —
 * which is why it takes an admin client explicitly rather than making one.
