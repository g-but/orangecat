/**
 * Rate limiting — the LIMITS live here; the algorithm lives in `limitkit`.
 *
 * ADR-0002 made this file the one canonical rate-limit module. limitkit
 * finishes the job: the window arithmetic, the bounded store, and the
 * standard headers are the shared package's, while every VALUE (how many
 * requests a route allows) stays here, because a limit is app semantics —
 * limitkit ships none on purpose.
 *
 * What this replaced (2026-09-05):
 *   - a hand-rolled `InMemoryRateLimiter` (fixed window anchored at the first
 *     hit, unbounded Map — the slow-leak shape limitkit's bounded MemoryStore
 *     exists to prevent);
 *   - an Upstash Redis path that was never configured in production (see
 *     ADR-0002 "Known, deliberately not fixed"): the live path was always the
 *     in-memory fallback, so deleting `@upstash/ratelimit`/`@upstash/redis`
 *     changed nothing at runtime. The deployment is a single self-hosted Node
 *     process behind Caddy, where per-process counting is correct. If a second
 *     instance ever exists, implement limitkit's two-method `Store` over
 *     something shared instead of resurrecting a second code path.
 *
 * All limiters are sliding windows — what the Upstash path always declared
 * (`Ratelimit.slidingWindow`) and what ADR-0002 specifies. Refusals count
 * nothing, so a hammered key recovers as soon as the traffic stops.
