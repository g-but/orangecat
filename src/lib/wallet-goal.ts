/**
 * Savings-goal progress for a wallet — the one place the two units are reconciled.
 *
 * A wallet's balance is BTC (`balance_btc`). Its goal is NOT: `goal_amount` is
 * denominated in `goal_currency`, and the wallet form defaults that to a fiat
 * code. Both surfaces that drew the progress bar divided one by the other
 * directly:
 *
 *   progressPercent = (wallet.balance_btc / wallet.goal_amount) * 100
 *
 * which is BTC ÷ CHF. Measured against production on 2026-08-26: 18 of 33
 * wallets carry a goal, every one of them in fiat (CHF 11, USD 6, EUR 1), and
 * not one in BTC. The bug is invisible today only because every one of those
 * balances is still 0.00 — it starts lying the moment the feature starts
 * working. A wallet holding 0.03 BTC toward a CHF 2 500 goal would have read
 * "0.0% funded" while sitting at roughly the whole target.
 *
 * Two components had their own copy of that expression (WalletCard, and
 * ProfileWalletSection on the PUBLIC profile), which is why this is a module and
 * not an inline fix: one definition of the comparison, and a gate
 * (scripts/check-currency-units.mjs) so a third copy cannot be written.
 *
 * The honesty rule this encodes: when the rate needed to compare them is not
 * available, there is no percentage. `useCurrencyConversion` returns 0 for an
 * unknown rate precisely so callers do not guess, and 0 read as a percentage
 * would claim "nothing saved" about a wallet that may be fully funded. In that
 * case `percent` is null and callers render the target without a bar.
