/**
 * One way to file a bug from inside the product.
 *
 * OrangeCat embeds FleetCrown's feedback widget (see src/app/layout.tsx), which
 * publishes `window.FleetCrown.report()` — it opens the feedback panel with the
 * failure already described and machine-readable context attached, so reporting
 * a bug is one click instead of "notice the floating button, open it, re-type
 * what the product already knew".
 *
 * Everything that wants to offer "report this" goes through here, so the
 * fallback behaviour is decided once: `widget.js` is loaded async and gated by
 * a server-side kill switch, so it may legitimately be absent. Callers get a
 * boolean and render a plain link to the feedback page when it is.
