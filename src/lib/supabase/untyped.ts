/**
 * Untyped Supabase access helpers — the ONE escape hatch for dynamic names.
 *
 * WHY: Supabase's TypeScript client types `from()` / `rpc()` against the
 * generated schema. When the table or function name comes from a runtime value
 * (DATABASE_TABLES.*, getTableName(entityType), a computed RPC name), TS can't
 * narrow the return type, so call sites historically cast `(sb.from(x) as any)`.
 * Rather than scatter that `any` — and its eslint-disable — across the codebase,
 * every dynamic-name access routes through here, so the escape hatch lives in
 * exactly one audited place (SSOT/DRY). Behaviour is identical to the raw call.

 * type-check, yet results come back as `Record<string, unknown>[]` rather than
 * `any[]`, so callers still have to narrow before use and inference in
 * downstream generic helpers does not collapse.
