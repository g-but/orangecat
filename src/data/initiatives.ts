 * 
 * Created: 2025-01-08
 * Last Modified: 2025-01-09
 * Last Modified Summary: âœ… REFACTORED from 901-line monolith to modular architecture - Option A Phase 1 Complete
 * 
 * BEFORE: 901 lines in single file (125% over 400-line limit)
 * AFTER: 6 modular files (~150 lines each) with clean imports
 * 
 * Performance Impact: Improved tree-shaking, better code splitting, easier maintenance
 * Architecture: Follows DRY principles, single responsibility principle
