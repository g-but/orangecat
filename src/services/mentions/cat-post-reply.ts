/**
 * Answering a mention on the wall.
 *
 * Same promise as in a private message — the Cat answers where it was asked —

 * a reply gets you an answer about that reply. Here the Cat reads the THREAD:
 * the post that started it and the replies leading to the one that tagged it.
 * "@cat is this realistic?" three replies deep is a question about the
 * conversation, and answering it from the last sentence alone is the difference
 * between an assistant and an autocomplete.
