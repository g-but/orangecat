/**
 * Answering a mention in a private conversation.
 *
 * "@cat what do you think about this?" is the question worth supporting, and
 * the whole difficulty is the word "this": it means the conversation, not the
 * sentence. So the Cat reads a recent window of the thread and answers there,
 * as itself, in a message row like anyone else's.
 *
 * SCOPE OF THE READ is a product promise, not an implementation detail. The Cat
 * sees CAT_CONTEXT_MESSAGE_WINDOW recent messages of the conversation it was
 * tagged in, and nothing else — no other conversation, no history beyond the
 * window. Tagging is the consent, and it is consent to this much.
