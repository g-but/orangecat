/**
 * Cat's groundedness enforcement — check, then one repair pass.
 *
 * The check itself lives in agent-core/verify.ts (mirrored from FleetCrown).
 * This module owns the Cat-specific policy around it: when a repair is worth
 * attempting, and — more importantly — when a repair must be REFUSED.
 *
 * Why refusing matters as much as repairing. The repair asks the model to
 * delete unsupported claims, and a model asked to delete will sometimes delete
 * more than it was asked to: the exec_action block, half the answer, or the one
 * correct sentence. A safety pass that quietly degrades good answers is worse
 * than no safety pass, because it fails in the direction nobody is watching.
 * So a repair is kept only when it clears all THREE guards below — fewer
 * violations, nothing newly invented, no dropped action — and otherwise the
 * original stands with its violations reported.
