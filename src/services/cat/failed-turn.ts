/**
 * What to store when a Cat turn fails.
 *
 * The success path persists a turn only once the model produced content, so a
 * provider failure used to drop the exchange entirely: the user's own words
 * were gone on reload, and the conversation was left with zero messages —
 * indistinguishable from someone who opened the page and never typed. Six real
 * accounts sat in exactly that state (June 2026), each having tried Cat once
 * and never returned, with no record of what they had asked.
 *
 * Kept as a pure function so the rule is testable without booting the
 * streaming orchestrator and its provider chain.
