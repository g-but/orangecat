/**
 * Cat acts inside the turn.
 *
 * ADR-0006 D2 — the change this whole ADR exists for.
 *
 * BEFORE: the model wrote its entire reply, and only then were ```exec_action```
 * blocks scraped out of the finished text and fired. The system prompt had to
 * carry a rule about it — "its result does NOT exist yet while you write —
 * announce it as in progress… NEVER as already done" — because the model
 * genuinely could not know. It could not say whether something worked, could
 * not retry a failure, and could not use one result to choose the next step.
 *
 * AFTER: the model calls an action as a TOOL, the action executes with every
 * existing gate intact (permissions, spend caps, confirmation, audit log), and
 * the RESULT goes back to the model as a tool message. The model writes its
 * reply last, knowing what actually happened.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT change: the executor. Every call still goes
 * through `CatActionExecutor.executeAction`, so permission checks, spend caps,
 * the `cat_action_log` row and the confirmation flow behave exactly as they did
 * when actions were scraped from text. The loop changes WHEN the model learns
 * the outcome, not WHO is allowed to cause it.
