/**
 * The grounding contract — the rules block that ships with every turn's facts.
 * MIRRORED MODULE (see core/README.md).
 *
 * Why this is generated rather than a hand-written constant: a standing prose
 * rule ("only use provided context") is a weak signal that models trade away
 * under format pressure. The failure that motivated this harness was exactly
 * that — a prompt demanding "1 focus, 3 tasks, 1 person, under 150 words, no
 * hedging" got four confidently-formatted answers, three of them invented,
 * against a context block that already said "if a question falls outside this
 * context, say so rather than guessing".
 *
 * The lesson: the model did not disobey a rule it forgot. It obeyed the
 * STRONGER of two conflicting instructions — fill five slots — because nothing
 * made the empty slot expressible. So this block does three things a static
 * prompt cannot:
 *
 *   1. Names the exact citation handles that exist this turn, so "cite a fact"
 *      is a closed-set choice rather than free text.
 *   2. Names the exact fields that are unrecorded THIS TURN, so the prohibition
 *      is concrete ("you have no affiliation for any person here") instead of
 *      abstract.
 *   3. Supplies the escape hatch verbatim, so refusing a slot is a cheaper
 *      token path than inventing one.
