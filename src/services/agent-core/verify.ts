/**
 * Groundedness verifier — MIRRORED MODULE (see core/README.md).
 *
 * Runs on the generated answer and reports claims the fact set does not support.
 * Deliberately deterministic: no second model call, no embedding round-trip, no
 * added cost or latency. That is a requirement, not a shortcut — this must run
 * on every turn including the free-tier ones, and a verifier that costs a
 * frontier call is one that gets disabled exactly where it is needed most.
 *
 * The insight that makes a cheap check work: fabrication is overwhelmingly
 * NOMINAL. Models invent organisations, titles, people, file paths, phone
 * numbers and dates — tokens that are mechanically recognisable and that must,
 * if genuine, have appeared in the retrieved records or in what the user said.
 * Grammar and hedging are hard to check; proper nouns and digits are easy.
 *
 * Scored against the real failure this was built from, every fabricated claim
 * is caught by the proper-noun or numeric rule:
 *
 *   "Ilya Druzhnikov (UZH)"                    → UZH: novel acronym
 *   "Accelerator & Bridge Program Manager"     → novel proper-noun run
 *   "University of Liechtenstein", "START Summit" → novel proper-noun runs
 *   "/opt/fleetcrown/runner/.env"              → novel path
 *
 * while the true parts ("Elena Weber SINGA Switzerland", "+41774730093") appear
 * verbatim in the records and pass clean.
