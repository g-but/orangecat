/**
 * Feed syndication — SSOT for which external feeds are pulled onto OrangeCat.
 *
 * The push half of cross-posting already exists (the external publish bus,
 * `src/services/timeline/externalPublish.ts`); this config drives the PULL
 * half: a sweep reads each feed and lands new items through that same bus, so
 * dedup (source + external_id), origin allow-listing, and the wall's "via …"
 * attribution all come for free.
 *
 * Feeds are pinned to a subject project by id — the sweep resolves the
 * project's owner at runtime and publishes on their behalf, which is safe
 * precisely because this list is code-reviewed config, not user input.
