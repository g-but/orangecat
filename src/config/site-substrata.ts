/**
 * Substrata's website, generated from its OrangeCat profile.
 *
 * Every word and number below comes from `substrata.ts` and
 * `substrata-coverage.ts` — the same objects the group profile, the product
 * catalogue and the Cat read. There is no second copy of the mandate, no
 * duplicated price list, and no separately-maintained "about" text. Change the
 * profile and the website changes with it, which is the whole claim /domains
 * is making when it says a profile can spin up a working site.
 *
 * That constraint is also why the site is honest: the coverage page cannot
 * quietly present unsourced research leads as findings, because the only data
 * it has is the same data the tests hold to `source: null`.
