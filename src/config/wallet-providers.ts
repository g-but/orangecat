/**
 * Wallet providers — SSOT for provider IDENTITY.
 *
 * Four places in this repo told a user which Bitcoin wallet to get, each with
 * its own copy of the names, URLs and platform lists:
 *   - the public guide (`/bitcoin-wallet-guide`) recommended Primal
 *   - the wallets page (`/wallets`) recommended BlueWallet and Phoenix
 *   - the wallet form's "don't have a wallet?" panel offered Primal and Coinos
 *   - the Nostr connection card linked Alby
 * They had already drifted, and none of them was reachable by the Cat — which
 * is the interface that actually meets a user with no wallet. The last two were
 * found by the gate in wallet-providers-ssot.test.ts, not by reading the code.
 *
 * So identity lives here once. Each surface keeps its own EDITORIAL (pros, cons,
 * difficulty, which subset it shows) and refers to providers by id. Changing a
 * URL is a one-line change; adding a provider cannot half-land.
 *
 * Only claims already made in this repo are encoded here. `lightningAddress` is
 * deliberately conservative: it means "this provider hands you a name@domain
 * address", which is the ONE capability OrangeCat needs to receive — not merely
 * "supports Lightning". A provider we are not sure about is marked false, so the
 * Cat under-promises rather than sending someone on a dead-end setup.
