/**
 * Cat plans — the ONE source of truth for everything pricing.
 *
 * Every fact about plans lives here: limits, prices, statuses, copy, CTAs,
 * upsell strings, and the tier↔plan mapping. The layers around it each have
 * exactly one job and never restate a fact:
 *
 *   config  (this file)         → WHAT the plans are. Numbers, copy, gates.
 *   SQL     (check_platform_limit / increment_platform_usage /
 *            user_plans.daily_limit in the baseline migration)
 *                               → ENFORCES the free limit at the counter.
 *                                 SQL can't import TS, so its literals are
 *                                 machine-guarded by the drift test:
 *                                 __tests__/unit/cat/plan-limit-drift.test.ts
 *                                 — change a limit on either side alone and
 *                                 CI fails, pointing here.
 *   services (provider-resolver, api-key-service, supporter/grant,
 *            credit-metering)   → APPLY the rules (BYOK bypass, metering,
 *                                 grants). grant.ts imports
 *                                 CAT_SUPPORTER_DAILY_LIMIT — never a literal.
 *   UI      (/pricing, /settings/usage, QuotaMeter, CatSettingsTab)
 *                               → RENDER only. No plan fact may be typed into
 *                                 a component; import it from here.
 *
 * Plans, honest about what's shipped ("sell intelligence, not rails" — P2P
 * payments stay 0% forever; the platform earns on Cat Credits):
 *   - free      → what every user gets today (CAT_FREE_DAILY_LIMIT msgs/day)
 *   - supporter → flat CHF/mo pass, raises the cap (DB tier 'pro')
 *   - byok      → your key, your bill, no cap, zero markup
 *   - credits   → pay-as-you-go frontier AI against a prepaid BTC balance
