/**
 * Substrate — Phase 1 coverage universe: the producers of the fifteen.
 *
 * The firm's first research product. For every material on the desk
 * (`substrata.ts` → CATALOGUE), the set of companies that mine, refine,
 * convert or recycle it. Mostly private, mostly uncovered: there is a great
 * deal of published research on chip designers and almost none on who fires
 * crucible-grade quartz or upgrades tin to seven nines.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE CLAIMS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
 *
 * Each entry asserts three things only: a company's name, where it operates,
 * and which step of the chain it occupies. Those are stable, widely documented
 * facts. It asserts NOTHING about capacity, market share, revenue, cost
 * position, or quality — the claims that go stale within a quarter, that move
 * markets when wrong, and that this firm has not yet sourced. There is no
 * field for them on purpose: the structure is the discipline, and the research
 * phase is what adds those numbers, each with a citation.
 *
 * Consequently every entry starts at `source: null`, which reads as UNVERIFIED
 * — a research lead, not a finding. An analyst clears a row by attaching the
 * primary source that confirms the company's role in that material. Coverage
 * progress is measured by how many rows have a source, not by how many rows
 * exist, and `coverageProgress()` below is what reports it.
 *
 * This is the mandate's own rule turned on the firm: an unsourced claim is
 * marked unverified rather than stated, however confident the analyst is.
