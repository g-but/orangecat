/**
 * Substrata — the participants of the singularity chain, graded by scarcity.
 *
 * The producer map answers "who makes this material". This answers the bigger
 * question: who is in the chain at all, from the ore to the buyer, and which of
 * them are actually hard to replace.
 *
 * THE SCARCITY GRADE IS THE PRODUCT
 *
 * A directory of everyone in a supply chain is a phone book. What makes this
 * research is the third column: for each participant, whether it is a
 * chokepoint, merely concentrated, or genuinely competitive. Grading some
 * participants "competitive" is not filler — it is the thing that makes
 * "chokepoint" mean something. A map where every node is critical is a map
 * that has not been read.
 *
 * The grades are the mandate's own screen (concentration, substitutability,
 * lead time, demand inelasticity) applied one participant at a time:
 *
 *   chokepoint   — one or a very few qualified suppliers, and no substitute
 *                  arrives on a horizon that matters. Removing it stops things.
 *   concentrated — a handful of credible suppliers. Substitution is possible
 *                  but slow, costly, or requires re-qualification.
 *   competitive  — many credible suppliers. Present in the chain, and not a
 *                  constraint on it.
 *
 * On the demand side the same grade reads as concentration of BUYERS: when a
 * handful of firms account for most of the world's orders, that is a scarcity
 * fact about the chain too, pointing the other way.
 *
 * Same verification discipline as everywhere else: each row claims a name, a
 * layer, a jurisdiction, a role and a scarcity judgement — and nothing about
 * revenue, capacity or share. Every row starts unsourced, which reads as a
 * research lead rather than a finding.
