 * every mention of that name across the platform points at. A reserved name is
 * one where being wrong about who owns it is harmful, not merely confusing.
 *
 * Reservations are compared after NORMALIZATION (see `normalizeUsername`):
 * lowercased with `_`, `-` and `.` removed. That is deliberate — `C-A-T` and
 * `c.a.t` read as "cat" to a human skimming a mention, and impersonation only
 * has to fool a human. Matching is exact after normalizing, so ordinary words
 * that merely contain a reserved word ("category") are unaffected.
