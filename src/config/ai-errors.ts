/**
 * Single source of truth for how an AI failure is explained to the person who hit it.
 *
 * Why this file exists: OrangeCat runs several AI surfaces (Cat chat, form
 * prefill, writing, image generation) that each used to invent their own failure
 * copy at the point of failure. That produced dead ends like
 * "Entity failed: Permission denied for entities actions" — a string assembled
 * from an internal category name, with nothing to click. The user is told they
 * are blocked and left to guess both the cause and the cure, even when the page
 * that fixes it already exists.
 *
 * The rule this file enforces: a surface reports a CODE, never prose. Copy, the
 * fix link, and the bug-report payload are resolved here, so every surface
 * explains the same failure the same way and gains a fix link the moment one is
 * added — no second edit at the call site.
 *
 * Invariant: every failure ends somewhere the user can act. `fix` when we know
 * the cure; a report to FleetCrown always (see src/lib/feedback/report.ts).
