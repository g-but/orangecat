/**
 * Who the Cat is, as an account.
 *
 * The Cat is a real profile rather than a rendering convention, and that single

 * Cat reply is an ordinary `messages` row and an ordinary `timeline_events`
 * row, so read receipts, search, deletion, threading, moderation and realtime
 * all work on it without branching.
 *
 * This file is the only place that knows the handle. `config/usernames.ts`
 * imports it for the reserved list, so the name the Cat answers to and the name
 * nobody else may take can never drift apart.
