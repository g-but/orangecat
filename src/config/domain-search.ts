/**
 * Domain search — SSOT for the availability check /domains offers.
 *
 * Finding a name is the rung BEFORE the two services /domains already sells
 * (build me a site, host it at yourname.orangecat.ch). Somebody who does not
 * yet have a domain cannot buy hosting for one, so this closes the front of
 * that funnel — and it is the same capability FleetCrown needs when it stands
 * up a customer, which is why the check lives behind a public v1 endpoint
 * rather than inside a React component.
 *
 * WHY THIS ASKS EACH REGISTRY DIRECTLY
 *
 * RDAP (RFC 7482) is the registries' own structured successor to WHOIS: free,
 * keyless, authoritative. The naive implementation asks a redirector
 * (rdap.org) for a domain and calls a 404 "available". Two things are wrong
 * with that, and this project shipped both:
 *
 * 1. A redirector cannot distinguish "no such domain" from "no such registry",
 *    so an unlisted TLD reads as free. That one was caught before launch.
 * 2. A redirector is a third party with its own availability. In production it
 *    began answering 403 to every query, which turned EVERY result into
 *    `unknown` — a search box that could not answer its own question, while
 *    still rendering as a working feature.
 *
 * So the query now goes to the registry named by IANA's bootstrap, which this
 * module already downloaded and previously used only as a yes/no gate while
 * discarding the very URLs that document exists to publish. No middleman is
 * left to fail.
 *
 * A TLD earns a definitive answer only when we hold its registry's own RDAP
 * base URL. Everything else returns `unknown`, and the UI says so. A search
 * tool that guesses is worse than one that admits the gap, because the guess
 * is what someone acts on.
 *
 * Created: 2026-08-26. Rewritten onto direct registry queries 2026-09-08.

/**
 * Registries that answer RDAP but are absent from IANA's bootstrap.
 *
 * Every entry here was verified in BOTH directions before being added — a
 * registered name returning 200 and an unregistered one returning 404 — because
 * an endpoint that 404s uniformly would manufacture exactly the false
 * "available" this whole module exists to prevent. Verified 2026-09-08:
 *
 *   .ch  google.ch, admin.ch → 200 · causius.ch, anwalte.ch → 404
 *   .io  github.io, google.io, nic.io → 200 · causius.io → 404
 *
 * `.ch` matters most: it is this platform's own TLD and its users' default, and
 * SWITCH began publishing RDAP after the original note here recorded that it
 * did not. That note stayed true-sounding and became wrong; re-verify these
 * rather than trusting the comment.
 *
 * Overrides deliberately take precedence over the bootstrap, so a registry that
 * IANA lists incorrectly can be corrected here without waiting for IANA.
