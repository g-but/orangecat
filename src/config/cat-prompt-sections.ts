/**
 * PROMPT SECTION BUDGET — which parts of Cat's brief every message pays for.
 *
 * Cat's static prompt is ~54,000 characters, and Groq's on-demand tier admits
 * about 41,000 once output and the user's own context are reserved. Cutting the
 * difference by editing is not available: there is no duplication left, and
 * every remaining rule ("never open with a list of questions", crisis handling,
 * "never pigeonhole") is there because Cat got something wrong without it.
 *
 * The waste is not in the words, it is in sending ALL of them EVERY time. A
 * message about pricing a mug currently pays for crisis handling, proxy mode,
 * notification triage and multi-entity strategy. So sections are classified:
 *
 *   CORE        — always sent. Capability, safety, and output contracts:
 *                 anything whose absence makes Cat unable or unsafe rather
 *                 than merely less sharp.
 *   SITUATIONAL — sent when the turn is plausibly about it.
 *
 * ── The line between the two is deliberate ──────────────────────────────────
 * A missing SITUATIONAL section costs sharpness: Cat still has every action,
 * tool and response format, it is just less coached on that topic. A missing
 * CORE section costs capability or safety — an action becomes unemittable, a
 * response format malformed, or a person in crisis gets a sales pitch. The
 * first is a degradation; the second is a defect. So when a section is
 * arguable, it goes in CORE.
 *
 * That is why `When Someone Needs Help, Not Strategy` and `Never Pigeonhole`
 * are CORE despite reading as situational: the cost of missing them lands on a
 * person having a bad day, not on a metric.
 *
 * Selection is keyword-based and deliberately GENEROUS — a false include costs
 * a few hundred characters, a false exclude costs behaviour. When in doubt the
 * matcher fires.
