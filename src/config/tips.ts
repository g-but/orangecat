/**
 * Tips — SSOT for the Bitcoin tipping surface.
 *
 * A tip is an UNCONDITIONAL Bitcoin gift from one person to another. It settles
 * NON-CUSTODIALLY: OrangeCat generates a payment request against the recipient's
 * OWN wallet (NWC / Lightning address / on-chain) and never touches the funds.
 * Zero platform fee — the tipper pays exactly the amount they choose.
 *
 * A tip is minted as an entity-less payment_intent (intent_kind='tip'), so it
 * rides the shared settle path: the tipper sees live confirmation and the
 * recipient gets the standard "you got paid" notification. Keep the copy honest:
 * we help you pay the writer directly, we don't hold or take a cut.
