/**
 * AI FORM ASSIST — CONFIG SSOT
 *
 * Everything the AI form filler shows or says that is *not* generic prompt
 * plumbing lives here:
 *
 * - `AI_ADJUSTMENTS`  — the catalog of one-click refinements ("make the
 *   description longer", "add a German version", …). Each entry declares which
 *   fields it applies to, so a form only ever offers adjustments that make
 *   sense for the fields it actually has.
 * - `AI_FILL_EXAMPLES` — the "Try:" starter descriptions per entity type.
 *
 * Both used to be hardcoded switch statements inside the prompt builder, which
 * meant entity types added to the registry silently got nothing. Keeping them
 * here as data means the bar is form-aware by construction and new entities
 * are one config entry, not a new `case`.

 * - `refine` — the form already has content; *revise* it. The AI's output wins
 *   for the fields it returns, because changing them is the whole point.
 *

 * request can never change anything, since every field it wants to rewrite is
 * already non-empty.
