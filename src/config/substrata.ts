/**
 * "Substrata" — OrangeCat-side SSOT
 *
 * An open-source research firm covering the chokepoints between here and a
 * technological singularity. Intelligence is not made of software. It is made
 * of purified tin, neon and rare-earth metal — and also of EUV scanners nobody
 * else can build, packaging capacity allocated years ahead, transformer slots,
 * grid queues, and process knowledge that does not transfer with a purchase
 * order. Behind each is a lead time and a dependency almost nobody has written
 * down in public.
 *
 * THE PRODUCT IS THE MAP. There is NO TRADING DESK, and this file must not
 * imply one: standing a regulated commodities book up is a long road through
 * licensing, and until it is walked, publishing prices or inviting enquiries to
 * deal would advertise a capability that does not exist. Research, data and intel are
 * the whole of the business today. When a desk exists it will be added here
 * with the disclosure rules that already sit below, written in advance
 * precisely so they cannot look like a reaction later.
 *
 * This file is the single source of truth for the firm's identity, its mandate
 * (the tests that make "focused" a rule rather than a slogan), its phases, its
 * desks, its listed catalogue, and its compliance and disclosure stance. The
 * Phase 1 coverage universe lives next door in `substrata-coverage.ts`. The
 * seed that registers the firm on-platform (scripts/seed-substrata.ts) reads
 * these two files and nothing else.
 *
 * On-platform shape: a `group` with label 'company' (public, so the research
 * and the book are both readable), its own `actors` row of actor_type 'group',
 * and a catalogue of `user_products` owned by that group actor. Ownership
 * follows the Revive My Old Ride convention — the founder's `mao` actor
 * creates it; swap to a dedicated actor by changing FOUNDER_ACTOR_SLUG.
