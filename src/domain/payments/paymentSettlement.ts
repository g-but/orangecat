 * poll, a background sweep, a recipient confirming). Any number of observers
 * may therefore report the same payment at the same moment.
 *
 * A plain `UPDATE … SET status='paid'` let every one of them proceed to the
 * side-effects: inventory would be decremented twice (overselling), Supporter
 * plans granted twice, the recipient notified twice, webhooks fanned twice.
 *
 * The row's own status is the lock. A conditional update is atomic in Postgres,
 * so exactly one caller can move a not-yet-paid intent to paid, and only that
 * caller is entitled to run the settlement side-effects.
 *
 * @returns true when THIS caller won the transition; false when someone else
 *          already settled it (a safe, silent no-op).
