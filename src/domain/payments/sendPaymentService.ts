/**
 * Sending money — the outbound half of the payment domain.
 *
 * Until now this logic existed only inside the Cat's `send_payment` tool
 * handler, so the ONLY way to pay someone on OrangeCat was to ask the Cat to do
 * it. Lifting it here gives the /send screen and the Cat one implementation,
 * and fixes two things the handler's inline version got wrong:
 *
 *  - it resolved recipients by reading `wallets.lightning_address` directly,
 *    which silently missed NWC-only recipients that the receive side handles
 *    fine. It now uses `resolveUserWallet`, the same resolution a payer gets
 *    anywhere else.
 *  - it could only pay a person. A pasted or scanned invoice — the common case
 *    when someone hands you a QR — had no path at all.
 *
 * Every outcome is a typed result rather than a thrown error, because the
 * caller has to tell "you have no wallet" (fixable by the user) apart from "the
 * payment failed" (not) and say so in words a person can act on.
