/**
 * Resolving a handle a profile no longer uses.
 *
 * A username here is a public profile URL AND a Lightning address
 * (`<username>@orangecat.ch`). So when an account is renamed — which the fleet
 * has to do for the 77 profiles still publishing their email local part — every
 * saved payment address and inbound link pointing at the old handle would
 * silently stop working. Silently: a wallet gets "no such recipient", nobody
 * gets an error report, and the money simply does not arrive.
 *
 * profile_username_history keeps the old handle resolving forever, so a rename
 * changes what a profile is CALLED without changing what can still find it.

/**
 * The profile id a retired handle used to belong to, or null.
 *
 * Goes through an RPC rather than a PostgREST filter. PostgREST reads `+` in a
 * query string as a space and supabase-js sends the character raw, so
 * `.eq('old_username', 'butaeff+ocauth2')` searched for "butaeff ocauth2" and
 * found nothing — measured against production, on two live profiles whose
 * legacy handles contain '+'. For those the profile redirect 404'd and a
 * Lightning payment could not find its owner, which is the precise failure
 * this table exists to prevent.
 *
 * An RPC argument travels in a JSON body, so nothing needs escaping and no
 * future handle can be mangled by the transport. The function lowercases and
 * trims server-side, so callers cannot drift from the stored form either.
