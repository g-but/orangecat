/**
 * What a claim is allowed to write onto the profile that claims it.

 * thing they wrote themselves.
 *
 * The version this replaced wrote `name` and `bio` unconditionally, so an
 * established user lost both the moment they accepted a gift (ADR-0004 D6,
 * defect #2). Pure and exported so the rule is testable on its own, rather
 * than only reachable through a compare-and-swap and two Supabase clients.
