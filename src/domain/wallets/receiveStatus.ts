/**
 * Owner-facing receive status — "what would actually happen if someone paid me
 * right now", answered by the SAME resolution the payer's request runs.
 *
 * Why this exists: the wallets page used to infer capability from field
 * presence in the client (`has an nwc_connection_uri` ⇒ "your Lightning address
 * works"). That is a different question from the one the payment path asks, and
 * the two silently disagreed in production: a stored NWC URI that this
 * deployment cannot decrypt resolves to the on-chain rail, which cannot serve a
 * Lightning address at all. The page claimed "share it anywhere" while
 * /.well-known/lnurlp/<username> returned an error.
 *
 * So: one authority (`resolveUserWallet` + `isLightningCapable`), consumed by
 * both the public LNURL endpoint and the owner's page. They cannot diverge.
