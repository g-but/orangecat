/**
 * Shared-wallet usage — the honesty layer for Bitcoin address reuse.

 * On-chain payments to the same address are publicly linkable by anyone with a

 * backer paying entity A can see (on-chain) that the address also collects for
 * B and C — so the platform should say so up front rather than let backers
 * discover it later.
 *
 * Deliberately disclosed as a BARE COUNT, never a list: naming the sibling
 * entities here would hand out an owner's full portfolio in one call — a
 * reverse-lookup the platform intentionally does not offer. The blockchain
 * only ever reveals payments actually made; we match that bar, not lower it.
