/**
 * Which handles to offer while someone types `@`, and in what order.
 *
 * Pure: given a query and some candidate profiles, it returns the menu. No
 * fetching, because the people query already exists — `/api/profiles?search=`
 * searches username and name, escapes LIKE metacharacters, and hides CI fixture
 * accounts. Writing a second query here would have re-inherited none of that,
 * and the fixture filter is exactly the kind of rule that gets fixed in one
 * copy and stays broken in the other.
 *
 * So the only new thing is the ORDER, and the order encodes one product
 * decision: THE CAT COMES FIRST.
 *
 * That is not favouritism, it is the fix for a discoverability bug. The Cat
 * answers to `@cat` on the wall and in DMs, and nobody guesses that. A feature
 * you have to be told about does not exist for the people who were not told —
 * so typing `@` shows it, before any name, on the first keystroke. It is the
 * difference between shipping the Cat and shipping a rumour about the Cat.
