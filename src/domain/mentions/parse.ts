/**
 * Turning message text into the handles it might be mentioning.
 *
 * Pure: no database, no HTTP, no framework. It answers "what could this text be
 * mentioning?" and nothing else — deciding which candidates are real people is
 * `services/mentions/resolve.ts`, because that needs a query and this must stay
 * testable without one.
 *
 * WHY CANDIDATES RATHER THAN A REGEX THAT MATCHES USERNAMES
 * The obvious approach is one pattern matching a legal username. It does not
 * work here, because real usernames contain characters the tokenizer must not
 * match greedily in prose. Measured on production 2026-08-26: 91 profiles, of
 * which four real accounts are `dacota-plaettli`, `m.schaupensteiner`,
 * `butaeff+ocauth2` and `georgy.butaev+ocauth1` — dots and plus signs that the
 * username validator does not even allow, because signup derives handles from
 * email addresses and bypasses it.
 *
 * So a mention of `@m.schaupensteiner` must match a dotted handle, while
 * `@bob.` at the end of a sentence must mean `bob`, and `ask @alice.` must not
 * invent a user called `alice.`. Both fall out of the same rule: emit every
 * prefix that ends at a separator boundary, longest first, and let the lookup
 * decide. `@bob.and.alice` offers `bob.and.alice`, `bob.and`, `bob` — whichever
 * exists wins, longest first.
