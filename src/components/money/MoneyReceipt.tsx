/**
 * MoneyReceipt — the confirmation moment, shared by every money surface.
 *
 * A payment app is judged on this screen. Before it existed we showed a static
 * tick and the word "Sent", which answers none of the questions a person
 * actually has the instant money leaves: how much, to whom, and when. Every
 * consumer money app answers all three at once, because the alternative is the
 * user re-opening their wallet to check we were telling the truth.
 *
 * So the receipt states the facts it can prove, and stays silent about the ones
 * it can't — a Lightning invoice with no amount really does settle without us
 * learning the figure, and inventing one would be worse than omitting it.
 *
 * Three channels of feedback, deliberately redundant: the tick animates in
 * (motion draws the eye), the phone buzzes (works when the screen isn't being
 * watched), and the numbers are stated in words. Any one of them can be missed.
