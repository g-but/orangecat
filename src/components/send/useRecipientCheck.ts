/**
 * Resolving who you're about to pay, while you type.
 *
 * Paying the wrong person is the one mistake on this screen that cannot be
 * undone — Lightning has no chargeback and no "cancel". Every consumer money
 * app therefore shows you the recipient's *name* before you can confirm, so a
 * mistyped username fails as a visible non-match rather than as a silent
 * transfer to a stranger. That check was missing here.
 *
 * The states mirror what the server will actually do with the same input
 * (see sendToRecipient), because a preview that disagrees with the payment is
 * worse than no preview:
 *  - anything containing "@" is treated as a Lightning address and paid
 *    directly, so we say plainly that we cannot vouch for who owns it;
 *  - anything else is an OrangeCat username and gets resolved to a real person
 *    with a real, working rail.
