/**
 * The band that says whose page this is.
 *
 * ADR-0005 D4. A page owned by an unclaimed actor is real, public and
 * fundable-looking — so it MUST say, unmissably, that it belongs to someone who
 * has not accepted it yet, and who set it up. That answers the creator's
 * requirement ("it should obviously state that this is not for me even though I
 * set it up"), gives the recipient their door in, and turns every visitor into
 * someone who might nudge her.
 *
 * It deliberately does not look like a warning. Nothing is wrong: a friend made
 * a page for someone, and that someone has not seen it yet.
