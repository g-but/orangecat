Always use useAuth in your UI/components,
Always wait for hydrated before showing anything that depends on auth,
Hydration: Make sure your auth state is hydrated before rendering protected routes.
Zustand Store: Your Zustand store should always reflect the Supabase session state.
Profile Editing: Only allow profile edits if the user is authenticated and the session is valid.

On App Load:
After hydration, always check with Supabase if there is a valid session.
If not, clear all state and storage.
On Network/CORS Error:
If Supabase is unreachable, show a clear error and clear state.
On Any Auth State Change:
If the session is lost, clear state everywhere.
