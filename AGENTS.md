# AGENTS.md — Start Here

This is the root entry point for AI agents working on Orange Cat.

Pointer-only: canonical content lives in the guides below. This file exists at the repo root to improve discoverability (GitHub surfaces root docs; some tools/agents look for `AGENTS.md` at the top level). Do not duplicate policies here.

Quick links:

- Project guide: `docs/guides/AGENTS.md`
- Universal agent reference: `docs/guides/ai/agents.md`
- Common principles (SSOT): `docs/guides/ai/COMMON.md`
- Agent specifics: `docs/guides/ai/claude.md`, `docs/guides/ai/cursor.md`, `docs/guides/ai/codex.md`
- Shared activity log: `docs/guides/AGENTS_SYNC.md`

This agent follows:

- `docs/guides/ai/COMMON.md` — single source of truth for shared practices
- `docs/guides/ai/codex.md` — Codex CLI–specific behaviors and patching patterns
- Database: Remote-only Supabase — see `docs/operations/REMOTE_ONLY_SUPABASE.md`
