/**
 * The primary CTA is the single most-read sentence on a public entity page —
 * it is the label on the button a stranger presses to part with money. Our
 * terminology guide bans a specific set of words there, for a reason that is
 * about product positioning rather than style:
 *
 *  - "donate"/"donation" frames the payer as a charity's benefactor. OrangeCat
 *    spans gift → loan → investment; the giving end of that range is still an
 *    economic relationship, not alms.
 *  - "tip" frames the payment as optional garnish.
 *  - "crypto" is a category we are not in — this is Bitcoin.
 *  - "campaign" is crowdfunding vocabulary we deliberately left behind.
 *
 * A `cause` shipped as "Donate" for months and nothing caught it, so this is
 * the check rather than a note in a doc.
