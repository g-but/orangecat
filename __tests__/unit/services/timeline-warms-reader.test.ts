/**
 * Every timeline read learns who is reading BEFORE it asks for the posts.
 *
 * Enrichment needs the reader's id to mark which posts they already reacted
 * to, and that id is a round-trip to /auth/v1/user. It used to be requested
 * only once the feed came back, with the three reaction queries then queued
 * behind it — three serial waves where two could overlap. Measured on a cold
 * timeline load: feed 3147-3520ms, then /auth/v1/user 3552-3784, then
 * reactions 3811-4076.
 *
 * The ordering is the whole point, so that is what these assert. A test that
 * only checked "the warm happens" would pass with the call left at the end,
 * which is the bug.
 *
 * The first version of this fix warmed inside getUserFeed — a function the
 * timeline page does not call. It went to production doing nothing. Hence the
 * table below: every read the facade exposes, not the one I happened to open.
