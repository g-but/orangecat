/**
 * Wall posts reach the queue through a database trigger, because posts are
 * written straight from the browser to a Postgres function and there is no
 * server seam to hook. That trigger is a PREFILTER: it queues anything
 * containing the substring "@cat", so `@catalogue` arrives here too.
 *
 * The point of these tests is that the prefilter is not the rule. Detection has
 * ONE implementation — the resolver — and the worker is where its verdict is
 * applied. A second copy of "what counts as a mention", written in SQL, is
 * exactly the kind of duplication that drifts silently.
