/**
 * The count a reaction reports back must survive the shape PostgREST sends.
 *
 * `like_timeline_event` and its three siblings are declared
 * `RETURNS TABLE(<name>_count integer)`, and a set-returning function comes
 * back as an ARRAY of rows: `[{ like_count: 1 }]`. The client indexed that
 * array as though it were the row, so the lookup was always `undefined` and the
 * `|| 0` fallback turned every successful like into a count of zero.
 *
 * It hid well. The filled heart comes from a boolean the client sets itself, so
 * liking something looked right while the number beside it stayed blank — and
 * for the eight months the RPC was also raising 42703, there was no successful
 * response to notice it in.
 *
 * Pinned against both shapes: the array PostgREST actually sends, and the bare
 * object it would send if one of these were ever rewritten to return a scalar.
