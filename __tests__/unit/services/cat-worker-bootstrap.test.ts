/**
 * The Cat has to be able to come into existence.
 *
 * There is a circularity hiding in this feature, and the first version shipped
 * into it: `resolveMentions` can only flag @cat when a Cat PROFILE exists, so
 * with no account nothing is ever queued — and if the account were only
 * established when something was queued, nothing ever would be. A freshly
 * deployed platform would sit there with @cat resolving to nobody, looking
 * exactly like a working feature nobody had used yet.
 *
 * So the worker establishes the account BEFORE it looks at the queue, and
 * before the empty-queue exit. This test is the thing that stops that ordering
 * from being "tidied up" later.
