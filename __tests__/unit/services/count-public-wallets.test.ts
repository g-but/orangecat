/**
 * The profile page counted a visitor-visible wallet through an RPC that has
 * never existed. `get_entity_wallets` appears in no migration and returns
 * PGRST202 in production, and the call sat inside a try/catch whose comment read
 * "if it errs we just show 0" — so the error path was not a fallback, it was the
 * only path.
 *
 * The count is not cosmetic: ProfileLayout hides the Wallets tab from visitors
 * unless `walletCount > 0` or the profile still carries a legacy address, so a
 * profile whose receive methods live in the modern wallets table showed a
 * visitor no way to pay it at all.
 *
 * These tests pin the two properties that matter. First that a real count comes
 * back. Second — the part that let the original hide for so long — that a
 * failure is LOGGED, not swallowed. Zero is still returned, because a badge must
 * not promise a payment method that might not be there; the difference is that
 * it now leaves evidence.
 *
 * Gated by scripts/check-rpc-exists.mjs; this is the instance.
