/**
 * Cat groundedness rules, served from the package.
 *
 * This file used to have a second job: asserting the src/services/agent-core
 * mirror was byte-identical to FleetCrown's canonical copy. That mirror is
 * deleted — both apps import `ai-kit/grounding` now, so there are no longer
 * two copies of "what counts as grounded" to diverge. (The mirror check also
 * self-skipped in CI, which clones one repo at a time; it only ever ran on a
 * laptop with both checkouts side by side. A gate that runs where nobody is
 * looking and skips where everybody is was part of why the extraction won.)
 *
 * What remains is the half that was always about Cat: grounding mode must
 * catch an invented attribute about one of the USER'S OWN records while
 * leaving general economic knowledge alone. A check that flags "Lightning"
 * gets switched off within a week, and then protects nothing.
