/**
 * Every fact the user names is accounted for out loud.
 *
 * forget_memories quietly narrowed its own input in three different ways, and
 * none of them reached the user:
 *
 *   * the memory store took the first 10 facts and dropped the rest;
 *   * the economic-profile store applied NO cap at all, so the two stores
 *     disagreed about which facts were even in play;
 *   * facts under 4 characters were discarded as too short to match safely.
 *
 * A dropped fact and a removed fact produced the identical reply. "🧹 Removed
 * X" while fact 11 was never looked at is the same lie as finding 8's — the
 * user believes data is gone that is still there.
 *
 * Separately, the "no stored match" list filtered the caller's RAW strings
 * against the stores' NORMALISED (trimmed) answers, so a padded `" cooking "`
 * could never appear in it however plainly it missed.
 *
 * bitbaum/orangecat#563 findings 10 and 11.
