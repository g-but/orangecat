/**
 * Section selection has to be safe BEFORE it is switched on.
 *
 * The tempting way to shrink a prompt is to send only what looks relevant, and
 * the way that goes wrong is well documented here already: an action that
 * appears nowhere in the prompt cannot be chosen no matter how correct its
 * handler is (see prompt-budget.test.ts, action-disambiguation.test.ts). So the
 * invariants below are the price of admission for turning the flag on:
 *
 *   1. Every section is deliberately classified — a new one cannot drift into
 *      either bucket by default.
 *   2. Core survives selection for ANY turn, including an empty message.
 *   3. Every enabled action stays emittable after selection.
 *   4. Selection actually buys enough room to matter.
