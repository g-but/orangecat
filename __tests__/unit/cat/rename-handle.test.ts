/**
 * The Cat can change your @handle, and says what happens to the old one.
 *
 * Reported by a user 2026-08-29: asked to change their handle, the Cat replied
 * that "usernames cannot be changed once set" because "changing it would break
 * all existing links", and offered a display-name change instead. It was not
 * inventing that. Its brief said "Never update username (it breaks public
 * URLs)", and the handler excluded the field for the same stated reason.
 *
 * Both were true until profile_username_history (20260826160000) made a rename
 * safe, and neither was corrected afterwards. That is the failure worth pinning:
 * a rule outlived the constraint that justified it, and a stale instruction is a
 * second source of truth about what the product can do — one that does not get
 * updated when the database gains a capability.
 *
 * So what is asserted here is the whole user-visible contract, not just the
 * write: the rename happens, and the reply says the old handle still works.
 * That fact is the reason it is safe, and a rename announced without it reads
 * exactly like the breakage the user was wrongly warned about.
