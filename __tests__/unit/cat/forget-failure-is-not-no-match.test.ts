/**
 * "We could not look" is not "you have no such memory".

 * Both forget stores used to swallow database errors into

 * looked properly and found nothing. So:
 *
 *   * a failed SELECT told the user no such memory existed;
 *   * a failed DELETE told the user nothing matched, while the memory they had
 *     just disowned was still sitting there.
 *
 * Telling someone their data is gone when it is not is the worst thing a
 * forget feature can do, and it did it silently. bitbaum/orangecat#563
