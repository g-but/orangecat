/**
 * Confusable verbs must stay disambiguated.
 *
 * Twice in one day a new Cat verb was shadowed by an older one with overlapping
 * vocabulary, and both times only production caught it:
 *
 *  - "add this topic to your public PROFILE" → the model ran update_profile and
 *    offered to edit the bio, so publish_interest was unreachable.
 *  - "REMOVE my public interests"            → the model ran forget_memories and
 *    deleted private memories, including one the user had held for weeks.
 *
 * The second is the dangerous shape: the wrong verb destroyed data. A model can
 * only pick the right verb if the descriptions say which is which, so that
 * routing text is a correctness requirement, not documentation. Adding a verb
 * whose trigger words overlap an existing one means adding a row here.
