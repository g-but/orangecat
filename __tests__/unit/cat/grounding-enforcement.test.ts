/**
 * Cat groundedness ENFORCEMENT policy.

 * The check itself is covered in agent-core-grounding.test.ts. What matters

 * must be REFUSED — because a safety pass that quietly degrades good answers
 * fails in the direction nobody is watching, and would be worse than the
 * observe-only behaviour it replaces.
