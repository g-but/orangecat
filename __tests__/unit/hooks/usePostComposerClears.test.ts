/**
 * The composer must be empty once the post exists.
 *
 * It was not. A successful post called `clearDraft()` — which discards the
 * SAVED draft — while `clearFormState()`, the one that owns `content`, was
 * reachable only from the offline-queue path and from `reset()`. So the text
 * you had just posted stayed in the box, and pressing post again hit the
 * server's duplicate guard ("You just posted this"), which reads as the button
 * being broken rather than as having already worked.
 *
 * Verified in production before the fix: the post was created at 12:18:10 and
 * the composer still held "ctrl enter round two" afterwards. It affected the
 * button exactly as much as the keyboard shortcut.
 *
 * This pins the two halves that have to hold together: the draft is discarded
 * AND the form is emptied, and the caller's own onSuccess still runs.
