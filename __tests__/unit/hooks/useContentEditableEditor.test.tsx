/**
 * The composer must empty itself after a post — including when it still has
 * focus.
 *
 * This is the bug that made Ctrl+Enter look broken in production. The shortcut
 * worked and the post was created; the composer simply kept showing the text,
 * because the effect that syncs `content` into the contentEditable bailed out
 * whenever the editor was the active element — which it always is right after
 * you press a key in it. So the natural response was to press again, and the
 * server rejected that as a duplicate ("You just posted this"), which looked
 * like a second failure.
 *
 * Clicking the button never showed it: a click moves focus to the button first,
 * so the guard did not apply. A shortcut and a button that disagree about
 * whether the composer clears is the shape worth pinning here.
