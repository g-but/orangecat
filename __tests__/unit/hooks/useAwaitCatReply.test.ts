/**
 * Tagging the Cat should behave like tagging @grok: you ask in the thread and
 * the answer turns up in the thread.
 *
 * The threading was already right — the Cat writes its answer as a child of the
 * post that tagged it. What was missing is that the answer never ARRIVED. The
 * thread refetches once when your reply is created, and the Cat takes 10–17
 * seconds to think (production 2026-08-28: 07:48:46 → 07:49:03, and 07:23:52 →
 * 07:24:02). By then the refetch is over, and there is no realtime subscription
 * on timeline events, so the reply sat in the database until a manual reload.
 *
 * Two things have to hold: it waits when the Cat was tagged, and it does NOT
 * wait when it was not — a phantom wait would leave "Cat is answering" on a
 * thread forever.
