/**
 * The hydration ceiling has to reach every gate, including `isAuthenticated`.
 *
 * `useRequireAuth` exposes `isLoading` and `hydrated` as EFFECTIVE values: once
 * a 4s ceiling fires, they resolve so a page stops waiting on an auth store
 * that is never going to answer. `isAuthenticated` was computed from the RAW
 * store instead, so it opted itself out of the ceiling.
 *
 * On /timeline that produced an infinite spinner. The page renders
 * `isLoading ? spinner : !isAuthenticated ? spinner : content`; the ceiling
 * cleared the first gate after 4s and the second stayed shut forever. It never
 * redirected either — the redirect only fires when there is no user, and there
 * was one. Measured live before the fix: 122 seconds of skeleton, zero network
 * requests, zero long tasks. The app was not slow; it was waiting on a gate
 * that could no longer open.
 *
 * The two cases below are the whole contract: a wedged store with a user must
 * eventually let the page render, and a wedged store WITHOUT one must not.
