/**
 * A project is the platform's milestone-accountability entity: people fund it on
 * the promise of work getting done by a date. The create form has collected
 * `target_completion` since the entity existed and no surface rendered it, so
 * backers could see the goal and never the deadline attached to it.
 *
 * The value already reached this component — the page fetch is `select('*')` and
 * spreads the whole row. What kept it off screen was the prop interface not
 * declaring it: a narrow prop type hides a wide payload, and the compiler cannot
 * warn about a field it was never told exists.
 *
 * Gated by scripts/check-dead-fields.mjs; this is the instance.
