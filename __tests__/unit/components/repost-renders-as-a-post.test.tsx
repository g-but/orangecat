/**
 * A repost is shown as the post it is; a quote repost shows two posts.
 *
 * A simple repost used to suppress its own content and render the original
 * inside a bordered panel instead — a panel repeating the original author's
 * avatar and handle, which the post header directly above was ALREADY showing
 * (PostCard swaps the reposter for the original author on a simple repost).
 * One repost drew the same person twice, two lines apart, with the actual text
 * boxed off underneath.
 *
 * The distinction these tests hold: a SIMPLE repost has one author and one
 * body, so it renders flat. A QUOTE repost genuinely has two of each, so it
 * keeps the nested panel. Collapsing both cases the same way would be the
 * opposite bug.
 *
 * Found live in production, one field over from the first bug: `usePostRepost`
 * sets `subjectType: 'profile', subjectId: userId` on EVERY repost — simple
 * or quote — purely to satisfy `createEvent`'s required fields. It always
 * resolves to the REPOSTER's own profile, so `event.subject` on a repost is
 * plumbing, never content. Rendered anyway, it showed as a second, unlabeled
 * name directly under the post body — the same header repeated a third time,
 * in a place with no visual explanation for why it was there.
