/**
 * A reply written by the agent has to say so.
 *
 * `is_cat_reply: true` was stamped onto every Cat reply, under a comment saying
 * it was "marked so the UI can render a Cat reply distinctly rather than
 * leaving a reader to work out from the avatar that this one was written by an
 * agent". Nothing read it — two writers, zero readers — so an answer from the
 * Cat looked exactly like an answer from a person, unless you happened to
 * recognise the handle.
 *
 * That is the difference that matters when copying how @grok works: the model's
 * replies are visibly the model's. Attribution of machine-written text to a
 * human reader is not a styling detail.
