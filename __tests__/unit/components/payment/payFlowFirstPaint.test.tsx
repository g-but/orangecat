/**
 * A pay link must open on the amount field, not on a spinner.
 *
 * /pay/<username> exists to be handed to someone else, so its first paint is
 * the whole product. It used to render a spinner while the browser asked
 * whether the recipient could receive — a question the server had already
 * answered on its way to rendering the page. Passing that answer down removes
 * both the spinner and the round trip.
 *
 * The modal keeps the client-side check: a wallet can be connected between
 * opening it twice, so there the question is genuinely open each time.
