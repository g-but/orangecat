/**
 * A quote repost has to reach the list it was made from.
 *
 * `usePostRepost` only hands the created post back if it was given somewhere to
 * put it: `if (result.event && onAddEvent)`. Nobody was giving it one —
 * usePostCardActions called `usePostInteractions({ event, onUpdate })` and
 * stopped there — so the repost was written to the database and then existed
 * nowhere on screen until a reload.
 *
 * Verified in production 2026-08-28: quote-reposting created event c09b9f0b
 * and the feed did not change.
 *
 * The bug was a missing ARGUMENT, not broken logic, which is why it survived: a
 * unit test of usePostRepost passes with or without it. So this asserts the
 * forward itself.
