/**
 * What a VISITOR receives is not what the owner receives, and this section was
 * written against the owner's shape.
 *
 * GET /api/wallets serves non-owners a curated PUBLIC_WALLET_FIELDS list. It
 * omits `is_active` and `balance_btc` — deliberately, so raw wallet internals
 * are not enumerable. Two consequences met here:
 *
 *   - the section filtered `w => w.is_active`, which for a visitor tested
 *     `undefined` and dropped every wallet. The heading rendered and not one
 *     card beneath it. (The API already filters is_active server-side, so the
 *     client-side filter was a second, wrong copy of that rule.)
 *   - the balance block formatted `wallet.balance_btc` unconditionally, and
 *     formatCurrency(Number(undefined),'BTC') is the literal string "₿NaN".
 *
 * Neither was visible until the Wallets tab itself started appearing again
 * (walletCount was permanently 0 — see check-rpc-exists.mjs), which is why a
 * fix to the tab had to come with this one.
 *
 * The rule both halves encode: a value we did not fetch is not a value of zero.
