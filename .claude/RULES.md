# Claude Code Project Rules

## CRITICAL: Environment File Protection

**NEVER delete, remove, or modify `.env.local` files under ANY circumstances.**

### Why This Rule Exists

The `.env.local` file contains essential API keys and secrets that enable seamless access to:

- **Supabase** (database and authentication)
- **GitHub** (version control and deployments)
- **Vercel** (hosting and deployments)
- **MCP Servers** (tool integrations)
- Other critical development services

### The Problem

When `.env.local` is deleted or modified:

1. All MCP server access is immediately lost
2. CLI tools (Supabase CLI, GitHub CLI, Vercel CLI) stop working
3. Development workflow breaks completely
4. Manual retrieval of credentials from multiple services is required
5. Significant time is wasted re-configuring the environment

### Allowed Operations

- ✅ **READ** `.env.local` to check configuration
- ✅ **ADD** new environment variables when needed
- ✅ **MODIFY** existing variables when adding necessary info
- ❌ **NEVER** delete the file
- ❌ **NEVER** remove existing variables unless specifically asked by the user
- ❌ **NEVER** suggest cleanup that includes .env.local

### When Performing Cleanup

If cleanup operations are needed:

- **ALWAYS** explicitly exclude `.env.local` from deletion commands
- **ALWAYS** use patterns like `rm !(*.env*)` or explicit file lists
- **NEVER** use wildcards that could match .env files

### Enforcement

This rule applies to:

- Direct file operations (rm, delete, unlink)
- Cleanup scripts
- Git operations (never commit, but never delete)
- Build processes
- Any automated workflows

**Remember: Protecting `.env.local` is not optional. It is a hard requirement for maintaining a functional development environment.**

## CRITICAL: Production Deployment Rules

**NEVER push to production without testing first.**

### Before ANY push to main branch:

1. Run the dev server locally (`npm run dev -- -p 3020`)
2. Test the feature/page manually in browser
3. Verify it works with real authentication
4. Check responsive design on mobile sizes

### After pushing to main:

1. Check Vercel dashboard - `npx vercel ls`
2. Verify deployment status is "Ready" for **Production** (not just Preview)
3. If only Preview deployed, manually promote: `npx vercel promote <preview-url> --yes`
4. Test on orangecat.ch before considering the task complete

### Why this matters:

- orangecat.ch is a live product with real users
- Broken production = damaged reputation
- Preview deployments don't auto-promote to production
