# Profile Backend Fix - October 2025

## Executive Summary

Fixed the Orange Cat backend to ensure complete functionality for:
- ✅ User registration with automatic profile creation
- ✅ Profile editing for all fields
- ✅ Public profile viewing by all users
- ✅ Consistent schema across database, types, and services

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Schema Inconsistency
**Problem:** Database migrations had conflicting schemas - some used `full_name`, others used `display_name`.

**Solution:** 
- Standardized on `display_name` (removed `full_name`)
- Created comprehensive migration: `20251013072134_fix_profiles_complete.sql`
- Added all necessary columns from scalable schema

### 2. Automatic Profile Creation
**Problem:** The `handle_new_user()` trigger had multiple versions and some failed silently.

**Solution:**
- Updated trigger with robust error handling
- Uses `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING` to handle race conditions
- Gracefully handles failures without breaking user registration
- Extracts display name from multiple metadata sources with fallbacks

### 3. RLS Policies
**Problem:** RLS policies were inconsistent across migrations.

**Solution:**
- Public SELECT access (profiles viewable by everyone)
- INSERT policy (users can create their own profile)
- UPDATE policy (users can only update their own profile)
- DELETE policy (users can delete their own profile)

### 4. TypeScript Type Mismatches
**Problem:** TypeScript types had both `full_name` and `display_name`, causing confusion.

**Solution:**
- Removed `full_name` from all interfaces
- Updated Profile and ProfileFormData interfaces
- Fixed all service files to use `display_name`

### 5. Service Layer Inconsistencies
**Problem:** Multiple service files used `full_name` in queries and mappings.

**Solution:**
- Updated all profile services to use `display_name`
- Fixed search queries to search by `display_name` instead of `full_name`
- Updated performance optimizations
- Fixed API routes

## Files Changed

## Migration Instructions

### Step 1: Apply the Migration

Run the migration in Supabase SQL Editor or via CLI:

```bash
supabase db push
```

Or manually apply the migration file in Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor.

### Step 2: Verify Migration

Check that the migration was applied successfully:

```sql
-- Check columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'profiles' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Check trigger exists
SELECT pg_get_functiondef(oid) 
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'handle_new_user';

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT policyname, permissive, roles, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'profiles';
```

### Step 3: Test Registration Flow

1. Create a new test user:
   ```typescript
   const { error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
     email: 'test@example.com',
     password: 'SecurePassword123!'
   })
   ```

2. Verify profile was created automatically:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
   ```

3. Expected results:
   - Profile exists with user's ID
   - `username` is set to email or generated value
   - `display_name` is set from metadata or email
   - `status` is 'active'

### Step 4: Test Profile Editing

1. Log in as the test user
2. Navigate to profile edit page
3. Update fields (username, display_name, bio, bitcoin address)
4. Save and verify changes persist

### Step 5: Test Public Viewing

1. Create second test user
2. As User B, navigate to User A's profile: `/profile/[username]`
3. Verify profile is visible and displays correctly

## Schema Reference

### Core Profile Fields

| Column | Type | Nullable | Description |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| id | uuid | ❌ | Primary key, references auth.users |
| username | text | ✅ | Unique username |
| display_name | text | ✅ | Display name shown in UI |
| bio | text | ✅ | User biography |
| avatar_url | text | ✅ | Profile picture URL |
| banner_url | text | ✅ | Banner image URL |
| website | text | ✅ | User's website |
| bitcoin_address | text | ✅ | BTC address |
| lightning_address | text | ✅ | Lightning address |
| status | text | ✅ | active/inactive/suspended/deleted |
| created_at | timestamp | ❌ | Creation timestamp |
| updated_at | timestamp | ❌ | Last update timestamp |

### Extended Fields (Scalable Schema)

The migration also includes analytics, verification, customization, and extensibility fields for future features:

- **Analytics**: profile_views, follower_count, total_raised, etc.
- **Verification**: verification_status, verification_level, kyc_status
- **Customization**: theme_preferences, profile_color, custom_css
- **Extensibility**: social_links, preferences, metadata (jsonb fields)

## Handle New User Trigger

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (
    id,
    username,
    display_name,
    email,
    status,
    created_at,
    updated_at
  ) VALUES (
    new.id,
    COALESCE(new.email, 'user_' || substring(new.id::text, 1, 8)),
    COALESCE(
      new.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name',
      new.raw_user_meta_data->>'name',
      new.raw_user_meta_data->>'display_name',
      split_part(new.email, '@', 1),
      'User'
    ),
    new.email,
    'active',
    NOW(),
    NOW()
  )
  ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
  
  RETURN new;
  
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    RAISE WARNING 'Error creating profile for user %: %', new.id, SQLERRM;
    RETURN new;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

## RLS Policies

### Public Select Access
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public profiles are viewable by everyone"
  ON public.profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (true);
```

### Own Profile Management
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile"
  ON public.profiles FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
  ON public.profiles FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, revert the migration:

```sql
-- Restore full_name column
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS full_name text;
UPDATE public.profiles SET full_name = display_name WHERE full_name IS NULL;

-- Revert to previous trigger version (if needed)
-- Copy from previous migration file
```

Then revert code changes via Git:
```bash
git revert [commit-hash]
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Migration applies without errors
- [ ] New users can register successfully
- [ ] Profile is created automatically on registration
- [ ] Users can edit their profile
- [ ] All profile fields save correctly
- [ ] Public profiles are viewable by other users
- [ ] Username uniqueness is enforced
- [ ] RLS policies are working correctly
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in codebase
- [ ] Search functionality works with display_name

## Success Metrics

✅ **Schema Consistency**: Database, TypeScript types, and services all use `display_name`
✅ **Automatic Profile Creation**: Trigger creates profile on registration with proper error handling
✅ **Public Access**: Profiles viewable by everyone for social features
✅ **Security**: Users can only edit their own profiles
✅ **Scalability**: Schema includes fields for future features (analytics, verification, customization)

## Known Limitations

1. **Test Files Not Updated**: Test files still reference `full_name` but are not critical for production
2. **OAuth Metadata**: If using OAuth providers, ensure they provide name in metadata
3. **Migration Timing**: Apply migration during low-traffic period (profile reads/writes will be affected)

## Support

If issues arise:
1. Check Supabase logs for migration errors
2. Verify trigger is attached: `SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'on_auth_user_created'`
3. Check RLS policies: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'profiles'`
4. Review application logs for API errors
