# Best Practices for Deployment and Monitoring

## Core Principles
1. Start simple and add complexity only when needed
2. Focus on core functionality first
3. Use built-in tools before adding external services
4. Document decisions and their rationale

## Initial Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Basic Vercel analytics enabled
- [ ] Core routes tested
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Domain setup verified
- [ ] SSL certificates confirmed

## When to Add Additional Tools
Only add error tracking and advanced monitoring when:
1. You have actual users experiencing issues
2. The basic analytics show problems
3. You need more detailed insights than Vercel provides

## Vercel's Built-in Tools
1. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Page views
   - Performance metrics
   - Error rates
   - Deployment history

2. **Logs**
   - Build logs
   - Runtime logs
   - Error logs

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Page load times
   - API response times
   - Build times

## Adding External Tools
Only consider external tools when:
1. Vercel's built-in tools are insufficient
2. You have specific needs not covered by Vercel
3. You have the capacity to maintain additional services

## Documentation
- Keep deployment documentation up to date
- Document any issues and their solutions
- Maintain a changelog
- Update environment variables documentation

## Security
1. Use environment variables for sensitive data
2. Enable HTTPS
3. Set appropriate security headers
4. Regular dependency updates

## Performance
1. Optimize images
2. Use proper caching
3. Minimize JavaScript bundles
4. Implement lazy loading

## Maintenance
1. Regular dependency updates
2. Monitor for deprecated features
3. Keep documentation current
4. Regular security audits

## When to Scale
Add more sophisticated tools only when:
1. You have actual scaling needs
2. Basic tools are insufficient
3. You have the resources to maintain them
4. The benefits outweigh the costs
