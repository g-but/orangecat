# Step-by-Step: Creating an Apartment Building in OrangeCat

**Scenario:** You want to set up "Sunset Apartments" - a 20-unit residential building in Zurich with shared governance and expenses.

**Time Required:** ~30 minutes  
**What You'll Create:**
1. Building Group (community aspect)
2. Building Asset (property aspect)
3. Link them together
4. Set up governance and features

---

## 🎯 Overview

An apartment building in OrangeCat has **two parts**:

1. **Building Group** - The community of residents
   - Members: All residents
   - Governance: How decisions are made
   - Treasury: Shared expenses (utilities, maintenance)
   - Events: Building meetings, social gatherings

2. **Building Asset** - The physical property
   - Property value
   - Location
   - Documents (deeds, insurance)
   - Can be used as collateral for loans

**They're linked:** The building group owns the building asset.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:
- ✅ You have an OrangeCat account
- ✅ You're logged in
- ✅ You have a Bitcoin wallet connected (optional, for treasury)

---

## Step 1: Add "Building" as Group Label (One-Time Setup)

**Note:** This is a one-time developer task. Once done, all users can create building groups.

**File:** `src/config/group-labels.ts`

```typescript
import {
  // ... existing imports ...
  Building, // Add this
} from 'lucide-react';

export const GROUP_LABELS = {
  // ... existing labels ...
  
  building: {
    id: 'building',
    name: 'Building',
    description: 'Residential building with shared governance and expenses',
    icon: Building,
    color: 'slate',
    defaults: {
      is_public: false,
      visibility: 'private',  // Only residents can see
    },
    suggestedFeatures: ['shared_wallet', 'events', 'proposals'],
    defaultGovernance: 'consensus',  // Residents decide together
  },
} as const satisfies Record<string, GroupLabelConfig>;
```

**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Result:** "Building" now appears as an option when creating groups.

## Step 2: Create Building Group (Community)

For this example, let's start from scratch.

### 2.3 Fill Out Group Form

**Group Type Section:**

  - This sets smart defaults (private visibility, consensus governance)

**Basic Information:**

  - All residents must agree on major decisions
  - Alternative: `Democratic` (majority vote)

## Step 5: Create Building Asset (Property)

3. This sets the `actor_id` to link group → asset

**Alternative (if UI doesn't support yet):**

- ❌ Voting feature: Database schema exists, but no service layer/API/UI
- ✅ Events: Fully implemented (use for building meetings)
- ✅ Treasury: Fully implemented (manual management)

**Workaround for Now:**
