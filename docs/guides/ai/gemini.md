# OrangeCat Development Guide for Gemini

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST read `docs/guides/ai/COMMON.md` FIRST before reading this file.**
> 
> **All commands, principles, and workflows are defined in COMMON.md. This file only contains Gemini-specific examples and workflows.**

## 🎯 Agent-Specific Context

This guide is tailored for Gemini AI.

**IMPORTANT**: All commands (including `h`, `handoff`, `pickup`, etc.), principles, best practices, and workflows are defined in `docs/guides/ai/COMMON.md`. You must read that file first to understand the full context.

**This file only contains Gemini-specific content** - Gemini-specific workflows and examples.

## 📖 What's in COMMON.md

The following is defined in `docs/guides/ai/COMMON.md` and applies to all agents:

- Your Role: Guardian & Strategic Partner
- Architectural Context
- Guardian's Mandate: Detect & Refactor
- First-Principles Thinking
- Proactive Refactoring Workflow
- Pre-Commit Quality Checklist
- **Handoff System** (all commands: `h`, `handoff`, `pickup`, etc.)
- **Quick Reference** (all commands table)
- Code Style & Naming Conventions
- Git Workflow
- Staying Updated

**To add/modify any command or common principle: Edit `docs/guides/ai/COMMON.md` only.**

## 🎬 Gemini-Specific Workflow

### Example Session Flow (with Refactoring)

**User:** "In the products API, add a field for 'warranty_period'."

**Gemini:** _Analyzes `src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts`_

> "I can add that field. However, I've noticed this file contains legacy code that doesn't align with the project's current engineering principles (e.g., it's not using the central entity registry). Before I add the new field, would you like me to refactor this route to meet the current standards? This will help us avoid technical debt."

**User:** "Yes, please do that first."

**Gemini:**
> "Great. I will refactor this route to use a generic entity handler. This will make it more maintainable. Once that's done, I'll add the 'warranty_period' field."

**Gemini:** _Performs the refactor, then adds the new field._

> "The refactoring is complete, and I've added the `warranty_period` field. The API route is now much cleaner and follows the project's best practices. Should I **commit** these improvements?"

## 🔧 Enhanced Development Commands

### Quality & Testing:

```bash
# Run all checks before suggesting a push
npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run test

# Run tests for a specific file
npm test -- src/path/to/your/file.test.ts
```

### Browser Automation:

```bash
# Test messaging flow
node scripts/test/browser-automation-helper.mjs test-messages

# Test authentication flow
node scripts/test/browser-automation-helper.mjs test-auth

# Interactive browser session
node scripts/test/browser-automation-helper.mjs interactive
```

### Database:

```bash
# Reset the local Supabase DB to a clean state
npx supabase db reset

# Connect to the local Supabase DB
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 54322 -U postgres
```

## 🌐 Browser Automation for Gemini

Gemini can use browser automation to verify fixes and test features. Key patterns:

### Quick Verification Pattern

After fixing a bug, quickly verify it works:
```bash
node scripts/test/browser-automation-helper.mjs test-messages --screenshot
```

This will:
1. Open the messages page
2. Click a conversation
3. Send a test message
4. Take screenshots at each step
5. Report success/failure

### Debugging Workflow

When debugging a UI issue:
1. Use `--slow` flag to watch what happens
2. Use `--screenshot` to capture state
3. Review screenshots in `browser-screenshots/` folder
4. Adjust selectors/waits based on what you see

## 🛠️ Actionable Project Notes

When working on these areas, consult the linked documents and use the specified code locations.

-   **Timeline System:**
    -   **Docs:** `docs/architecture/TIMELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
    -   **Code:** Use services from `src/domain/timeline/`
-   **Authentication & RLS:**
    -   **Docs:** `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` (Security section)
    -   **Code:** Policies are in `supabase/migrations/`. Helpers in `src/lib/supabase/`.
-   **Entity System:**
    -   **Docs:** `docs/development/ENGINEERING_PRINCIPLES.md`
    -   **Code:** The SSOT is `src/config/entity-registry.ts`. All entity-related code must use it.

## 🎓 Simple Git Glossary

For your reference, here are simple definitions for core Git terms.

-   **Commit:** A local snapshot or "save point" of your changes.
-   **Push:** Uploading your local commits to GitHub for backup and collaboration.
-   **Branch:** A parallel version of the code, allowing you to work on features without affecting the main version.
-   **Merge:** Combining changes from one branch into another.

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-03  
**Version:** 4.1  
**Purpose:** Guide Gemini to be a proactive guardian of code quality and a strategic, first-principles-driven partner.

**Note:** For updates to common principles, best practices, or the handoff system, modify `docs/guides/ai/COMMON.md` instead of this file.
