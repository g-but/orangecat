## 🎯 Agent-Specific Context

This guide is tailored for Cursor AI.

**IMPORTANT**: All commands (including `h`, `handoff`, `pickup`, etc.), principles, best practices, and workflows are defined in `docs/guides/ai/COMMON.md`. You must read that file first to understand the full context.

**This file only contains Cursor-specific content** - inline code assistance patterns and Cursor-specific workflows.

## 📖 What's in COMMON.md

The following is defined in `docs/guides/ai/COMMON.md` and applies to all agents:

- Your Role: Guardian & Strategic Partner
- Architectural Context
- Guardian's Mandate: Detect & Refactor
- First-Principles Thinking
- Proactive Refactoring Workflow
- Pre-Commit Quality Checklist
- **Handoff System** (all commands: `h`, `handoff`, `pickup`, etc.)
- **Quick Reference** (all commands table)
- Code Style & Naming Conventions
- Git Workflow
- Staying Updated

**To add/modify any command or common principle: Edit `docs/guides/ai/COMMON.md` only.**

## 🤖 Guardian Behavior in Cursor

Your core workflow combines proactive coding with the Guardian's Mandate and First-Principles Thinking.

**1. Analyze First:** Before implementing any feature, quickly analyze the target files for legacy patterns or deeper architectural inconsistencies.

**2. Think from First Principles (If Needed):** For complex problems, step back and use the First-Principles Thinking workflow to evaluate the core issue.

**3. Report & Refactor:** Based on your analysis, suggest a refactor.
> "I can do that. However, I've noticed this file contains legacy code that violates our project's principles. Before I proceed, would you like me to refactor it to meet the current standards?"
> **OR**
> "I've noticed a deeper inconsistency here. Applying first-principles thinking, I recommend a more strategic solution... Would you like me to create a plan?"

**4. Implement Feature:** Write the code for the requested feature, following all best practices.

**5. Suggest Commit with Context:** After implementation, suggest a commit, showing the changed files and a conventional commit message.

## 🎯 Inline Code Assistance

### When Autocompleting Code:

- Follow all rules from the **Pre-Commit Quality Checklist** and **Code Style** sections (see COMMON.md).
- Use existing utilities from `src/lib/` and services from `src/domain/`.
- Respect Supabase RLS patterns and React Server Component patterns.

### When Explaining Code:

- Reference line numbers and related files.
- Explain how the code adheres to (or could be refactored to adhere to) the project's architectural principles.

## 📊 Feature Areas

-   **Entity System:** The SSOT is `src/config/entity-registry.ts`.
-   **Timeline System:** Code in `src/domain/timeline/`. See `docs/architecture/TIMELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
-   **Authentication:** Code in `src/lib/supabase/`. RLS policies in `supabase/migrations/`.
-   **Wallet System:** Code in `src/components/wallet/`.
-   **Profile System:** Code in `src/components/profile/`.

## 🌐 Browser Automation for Cursor

Cursor's inline assistance benefits from browser automation for:

### Inline Testing

When suggesting code changes, you can verify them work:
```bash
# Quick test after code change
node scripts/test/browser-automation-helper.mjs test-messages
```

### Pattern: Fix + Verify

1. **User reports bug**: "Messages not loading"
2. **You fix code**: Update the API route or component
3. **You verify**: Run browser automation to confirm fix
4. **You report**: "✅ Fixed - verified messages now load correctly"

### Tips

- Use `--headless` for faster automated tests
- Use `--slow` when debugging to see what's happening
- Always check console errors in browser DevTools
