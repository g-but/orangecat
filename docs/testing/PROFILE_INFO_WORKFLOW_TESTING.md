## 🐛 Common Issues to Watch For

1. **View mode showing edit forms**
   - Check that `onSave` prop is NOT passed to `ProfileInfoTab`
   - Verify URL is `/dashboard/info` not `/dashboard/info/edit`

2. **Edit mode missing guidance sidebar**
   - Check that `DynamicSidebar` is included in edit page
   - Verify `onFieldFocus` prop is passed to `ModernProfileEditor`

3. **Wallets appearing in profile editor**
   - Verify `ModernProfileEditor` doesn't include wallet fields
   - Should only show link to wallets page

4. **Navigation not working**
   - Check sidebar link points to `/dashboard/info`
   - Check dropdown "Edit Profile" points to `/dashboard/info/edit`
   - Verify all Link components have correct hrefs

## 📝 Notes

- The view mode is intentionally read-only to reduce cognitive load
- Edit mode uses the same guidance system as project editing for consistency
- Wallets are intentionally separated for better organization
- All navigation should be clear and intuitive
