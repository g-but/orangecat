# OrangeCat Platform - Architecture & Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Status:** ✅ Architecture Defined, Ready for Implementation

---

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### 1. **Defined Clear Entity Distinctions**

We established four core entities with clear purposes:

| Entity | Purpose | Ownership |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Profile** | Individual user account | Self-owned |
| **Organization** | Group entity with multiple members | Multi-member governance |
| **Campaign** | Time-bound fundraising initiative | Profile or Organization |
| **Project** | Long-term ongoing initiative | Profile or Organization |

### 2. **Created Complete Database Architecture**

**New Tables Created:**
- ✅ `organization_members` - Manages organization membership with roles & permissions
- ✅ `projects` - Tracks long-term initiatives
- ✅ `project_id` foreign key added to projects

**All tables include:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Automatic timestamp updates
- Performance indexes
- Full-text search (where applicable)

### 3. **Updated TypeScript Types**

**File:** `/src/types/database.ts`

Added complete type definitions for:
- `OrganizationMember` (Row, Insert, Update)
- `Project` (Row, Insert, Update)
- Form data types: `OrganizationFormData`, `ProjectFormData`
- Permission types: `OrganizationPermissions`
- Extended types with relationships

## 📁 Files Created

### Architecture Documentation
1. **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Complete entity definitions and relationships
2. **`IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`** - Step-by-step implementation instructions
3. **`SUMMARY.md`** - This file

### Database Migrations
4. **`supabase/migrations/20251013_create_organization_members.sql`**
   - Creates organization membership table
   - Includes RLS policies for security
   - Granular permissions system

5. **`supabase/migrations/20251013_create_projects.sql`**
   - Creates projects table
   - Auto-generates slugs
   - Full-text search enabled

6. **`supabase/migrations/20251013_add_project_to_projects.sql`**
   - Links projects to projects

### TypeScript Updates
7. **`src/types/database.ts`** - Updated with new table types

## 🔐 Permission Model

### Who Can Edit What?

| Entity | Edit Permission |
|--------|----------------|
| **Profile** | Only the profile owner |
| **Organization** | Members with `can_edit_org` permission |
| **Campaign (personal)** | Only the creator |
| **Campaign (org)** | Org members with `can_create_projects` |
| **Project (personal)** | Only the owner |
| **Project (org)** | Org members with edit permissions |

### Organization Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control, can delete organization |
| **Admin** | Can manage members, edit settings, create projects |
| **Member** | Standard access, can view and contribute |
| **Contributor** | Limited access, can contribute content |

## 🚀 Next Steps (In Order)

### Phase 1: Database Setup (IMMEDIATE)
1. Apply database migrations via Supabase CLI or Dashboard
2. Verify tables created successfully
3. Test RLS policies

### Phase 2: Service Layer (HIGH PRIORITY)
4. Create `/src/services/supabase/organization-members.ts`
5. Create `/src/services/supabase/projects.ts`
6. Add permission checking utilities

### Phase 3: API Routes (HIGH PRIORITY)
7. Create `/src/app/api/organizations/[id]/members/route.ts`
8. Create `/src/app/api/projects/route.ts`
9. Create `/src/app/api/projects/[slug]/route.ts`

### Phase 4: UI Components (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
10. Create organization member management UI
11. Create project creation/editing forms
12. Create project-to-project linking UI

### Phase 5: Testing (HIGH PRIORITY)
13. Write integration tests
14. Test permission checks
15. Verify RLS policies work correctly

## 📊 Data Model Overview

```
Profile (Individual User)
  ├─ creates → Campaign (Personal Fundraising)
  ├─ founds → Organization (Group Entity)
  ├─ joins → Organization (via organization_members)
  └─ maintains → Project (Long-term Initiative)
                    └─ contains → Campaign

Organization
  ├─ has → Members (via organization_members)
  ├─ creates → Campaign (Org Fundraising)
  └─ manages → Project
                └─ contains → Campaign
```

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Campaign vs Project
- **Campaign**: Time-bound fundraising with specific goal
- **Project**: Ongoing initiative that may have multiple projects
- **Rationale**: Allows sustained fundraising over time

### 2. Organization Membership
- **Decision**: Use `organization_members` table instead of generic associations
- **Rationale**: Clearer schema, better performance, specific permissions

### 3. Polymorphic Ownership
- **Decision**: Projects/Projects can be owned by Profile OR Organization
- **Rationale**: Maximum flexibility for different use cases

### 4. Bitcoin Integration
- **Decision**: Each entity has own Bitcoin/Lightning address
- **Rationale**: Clear fund attribution and distribution

## 🤔 Questions to Resolve (Optional Enhancements)

These are NOT blockers, but future considerations:

- [ ] Should organizations have "sub-organizations" or "departments"?
- [ ] How do we handle organization verification (KYC)?
- [ ] Should projects have sub-projects or milestones?
- [ ] How do we handle Bitcoin distribution to organization members?
- [ ] Do we need approval workflows for projects/projects?
