**Last Modified Summary**: Initial creation of Bitcoin wallet guide feature documentation

## Overview

The Bitcoin Wallet Guide is a dedicated page that helps users who don't have a Bitcoin wallet get one set up quickly and easily. This feature addresses a common barrier for new users who want to receive Bitcoin donations on OrangeCat but don't know how to get started with Bitcoin.

## Purpose

Many users come to OrangeCat wanting to create campaigns or profiles but get stuck when asked for a Bitcoin address because they don't have a Bitcoin wallet yet. This guide provides:

1. **Clear explanations** of what a Bitcoin wallet is
2. **Curated wallet recommendations** with pros/cons
3. **Step-by-step guidance** for getting started
4. **Security best practices** for new users
5. **FAQ section** addressing common concerns

## Implementation

### Page Location
- **URL**: `/bitcoin-wallet-guide`
- **File**: `src/app/bitcoin-wallet-guide/page.tsx`

### Integration Points

The guide is linked from three key locations where Bitcoin addresses are requested:

1. **Profile Setup** (`src/app/profile/setup/page.tsx`)
   - Shows when Bitcoin address field is empty

2. **Campaign Creation** (`src/app/create/page.tsx`)
