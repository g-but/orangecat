## Next Priority: Performance Optimization & Final Polish

**Goal:** Complete Week 4 of the PRD.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Performance Optimization:**
    - Analyze bundle size reports for further reductions.
    - Profile component rendering to identify and fix bottlenecks.
    - Implement code splitting or lazy loading where beneficial.
2.  **Final Polish:**
    - Comprehensive mobile device testing.
    - Refine animations and user feedback.
