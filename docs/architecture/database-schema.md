# üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the **simplified database schema** for the OrangeCat Bitcoin crowdfunding platform. The database uses Supabase and includes 5 core tables optimized for multi-entity transactions and transparency.

**Key Features:**
- **5 Essential Tables** (simplified from 10+)
- **Unified Projects Entity** (consolidated campaigns + projects)
- **Multi-Entity Transactions** (any entity can donate to any other)
- **Bitcoin-Native Design** (Lightning/Bitcoin addresses for all entities)
- **Transparency by Default** (public transaction visibility)
