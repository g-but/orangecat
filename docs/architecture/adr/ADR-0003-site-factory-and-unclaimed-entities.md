# ADR-0003: The Site Factory, and Entities Nobody Has Claimed Yet

Date: 2026-08-27
Amended: 2026-08-28
Status: Proposed

> **Amendment, 2026-08-28.** The original decision made the OrangeCat claim the

## Context

The studio wants to prospect at volume: find a business with a bad website,
build a better one unasked, and offer it. `camille.orangecat.ch` is that pitch
built once by hand, and `substrata.orangecat.ch` is the same product with its
content expressed as data.

Four things about the existing code decide most of this:

1. **`substrata/config/site-content.ts` already models a site as data** — a
   closed union of section kinds (`hero`, `prose`, `stats`, `cards`,
   `definitions`, `index`, `table`, `meter`), pages as config, one catch-all
   route. `camille-boulangerie` is the same product hand-rolled as `.tsx`.
2. **`public.profile_claims` already models a draft that is not yet a person.**
   `profiles.id` is a validated FK to `auth.users(id)`, so a profile *cannot*
   exist before its subject has an account. The claims table is the holding area:
   the row id is the claim token, there are no RLS policies at all, and every
   read goes through a server route on the service-role client.
3. **The claim flow is built, not hypothetical.** `/claim/[id]` renders the draft
   under `noindex`; `claimProfileClaim` does a compare-and-swap on
   `status = 'pending'` so two tabs cannot both win, resolves username collisions
   via `findAvailableUsername`, copies the draft onto the caller's own profile,
   and rolls the claim back to `pending` if that copy fails. Revoke and a
   180-day expiry exist. What is missing is only the door in front of it.
4. `integration_keys` / `webhook_endpoints` already carry FleetCrown's calls.

And one fact about the stack: OrangeCat is the **economy** pillar, Solon the
**governance** pillar, FleetCrown the **engineering** one. A prospect is being
sold a website. The pillars are what they may *later* want.

## Problem Statement

Three questions, and they have different answers.

**What does the prospect actually decide?** Someone who has never heard of us
opens one link. They must understand the offer, want it, and be able to say yes
or no in a single click. Anything they have to learn first is a leak.

**Where does the pipeline live?** It touches site generation, prospect tracking,
and a fundable entity. Putting all of it in one repo puts prospecting code inside
the money boundary, or money code inside a CRM.

**How does an entity exist before its subject agrees to it?** A profile that can
raise needs an account the business has not created. `profile_claims` answers
this for a *person* (name, bio, avatar, links). It has no notion of a business,
a group, or anything that can receive funds.

## Decision

Four layers, split on the boundary that already exists.

**1. `sitekit` — a shared package, extracted from Substrata.** The section-shape
schema, the renderers, and a `siteFromUrl()` extractor. Not in this repo.

The reason this is the whole efficiency argument: the generator emits **data
against a closed schema**, never `.tsx` against nothing. A model filling eight
known section kinds is a task with a machine-checkable result; a model writing
components is not. Per-site quality then becomes a property of the renderers —
fixing the `cards` renderer improves every site ever generated. It ships no
design tokens: each site keeps its own `globals.css`, because the system is
uniform and the aesthetics are not.

**2. FleetCrown — the pipeline and the proposal.** Scrape, assess, generate,
propose, hand over. FleetCrown already models this shape (projects, crew
assignments, agent runs, activity). A prospect is a project that has not said yes
yet.

**The proposal is FleetCrown's object, and it is deliberately not behind
OrangeCat auth** — requiring an account to *read an offer* is the leak this
amendment exists to close. It carries its own token, and accept/decline needs no
login.

**3. OrangeCat — the economy add-on (opt-in).** Unchanged mechanically, demoted
in the funnel. Two changes here:

- **Generalise `profile_claims` into entity claims.** Same primitive, same
  id-is-the-token design, same service-role-only posture. The `draft` jsonb
  grows a discriminated `kind`, so a draft can describe a group and the projects
  under it, not only a person.
- **Add an ingest door**: `POST /api/claims/ingest` taking `{ url }` or
  `{ text }`, extracting via Cat, and writing **one pending claim**. The same
  endpoint serves FleetCrown's pipeline and a human typing a sentence to Cat —
  deliberately, so the pipeline gets no privileged path a person cannot use.

**4. Solon — the governance add-on (opt-in, and narrower still).** Irrelevant to
a bakery; real for a Verein, a co-op, an association — anything with members who
vote. Offer it only where the entity has that shape. It is an upsell to an upsell
and must never appear in a first contact.

## The proposal

The artifact a stranger opens. It has to survive being read by someone who has
never heard of the studio, in under a minute.

- **The live site, at a real URL.** Not a screenshot, not a PDF. `noindex`,
  carrying the `DemoBanner` that says it is an unsolicited mockup by the studio.
- **Before and after, side by side.** This is the entire emotional argument and
  it needs no words.
- **What is wrong with the current one, measured.** Not adjectives — the load
  time, the contrast failures, the missing phone link, no HTTPS, unusable on a
  phone. `dotfiles/scripts/ci/ui-defect-audit.mjs` already renders live sites and
  finds AA contrast failures and misaligned stacks; the assessment step is that
  tool pointed outward.
- **What we could not find out about you.** The empty fields, shown as empty.
  This is the strongest paragraph in the document: what we could not learn about
  you in five minutes is what your customers also cannot.
- **Price, and what happens on yes.**
- **Two buttons: Accept, and Not interested.**

**"Not interested" must be one click and must actually work** — it takes the site
down, with no counter-offer and no follow-up. That is what makes it defensible to
send something unsolicited at all.

Proposal states: `draft → sent → viewed → accepted | declined | expired`.
`viewed` is the only interesting commercial signal. `declined` and `expired` both
tear the site down and revoke any attached claim.

**On yes, the deliverable is the website** — the repo, or hosting it on their
domain. Nothing about Bitcoin has been mentioned yet. Only then, as a separate
sentence: *you can also have a public profile that accepts payments.* If that
lands, the claim link from layer 3 is the door, and it is the same flow that
already ships.

## Rationale

- **The offer must be legible to someone who knows nothing.** A better website is
  self-evidently valuable to a baker. A Bitcoin-native economic profile is not,
  and putting it first means the conversion rate of the website business is
  capped by the hardest concept in the stack.
- **Onboarding is the upside, not the entry fee.** Every accepted site is a
  warm relationship with a real business — a far better position from which to
  introduce OrangeCat than a cold link ever was. Making it optional is what makes
  it *possible*.
- **Blast radius.** Claim tokens, identity and fundraising sit on one side of a
  network boundary. Prospecting code cannot widen them by accident because it
  cannot reach the tables.
- **SSOT.** There is one definition of "an entity that can raise" and it is this
  repo's. A second one inside a CRM would be a second source of truth about money.
- **The 2-files test.** A new section kind touches `sitekit` only. A new prospect
  state touches FleetCrown only. A new claimable kind touches this repo only.

## The invariant this exists to protect

**Money must never be routable to an entity whose subject has not accepted it.**

The architecture gives this for free, on one condition: **ingest writes to the
claims table and never to `profiles`.** A pending claim has no `auth.users` row
behind it, therefore no wallet, no Lightning address, no way to receive. That is
a structural guarantee, not a policy someone has to remember — and it is the one
line in this design that must not be crossed for convenience.

Making OrangeCat opt-in **strengthens** this: most prospects now never get a
claim row at all, so the invariant holds vacuously for the majority rather than
resting on pipeline discipline.

Two supporting rules, from `camille-boulangerie/HANDOVER.md`, which rehearsed
this end to end on 2026-08-27 and found (§4) that its scraped-and-pseudonymised
content **cannot be handed to a client** — it would be a restyled copy of a
competitor's copy:

- **Pseudonymisation is a portfolio device, not a safety device.** Fully
  fictional demos (Camille) are safe to publish because nobody is represented.
  A pitch aimed at a real business uses that business's **real** name, on our
  subdomain, `noindex`, carrying the `DemoBanner`, with takedown on request and
  no negotiation. A near-miss name reads as either a mistake or a knock-off, and
  it makes the artifact undeliverable.
- **Fabricate no facts** — not the address, hours, prices, or reviews. A
  plausible-but-wrong street number is the single detail that actively damages
  the business the pitch is meant to win.

**Make that second rule checkable rather than remembered.** A closed schema
invites completion: a model handed a `stats` section wants numbers in it. So
`sitekit` distinguishes **unknown** from **empty**, and every generated field
carries its provenance — source URL, or `inferred`. No field may ship with
`inferred` provenance in a real pitch. That turns "we invented nothing" from a
promise into an assertion, and it is what makes the empty-fields paragraph above
honest.

## Consequences

- One migration here (claims `draft` gains a discriminated kind) and one new
  route. The claims table's no-RLS, service-role-only posture is inherited
  deliberately; do not add a permissive policy to make the pipeline simpler.
- FleetCrown grows a proposal object with its own token and public read. It must
  not reach into this repo's tables to render one.
- Substrata and Camille both become `sitekit` consumers, which is how the schema
  gets tested before it is pointed at strangers.
- A prospect that is never claimed expires on the existing 180-day clock and
  costs nothing.
- Conversion is now measurable in two independent steps — site accepted, and
  profile claimed. Collapsing them would have hidden which one is failing.

## Implementation order

1. Extract `sitekit` from Substrata and **rebuild Camille on it**. That rebuild
   is the schema's test: if Camille cannot be expressed in the closed union, the
   union is wrong, and it is cheaper to learn that on a site we own.
2. Build the proposal page in FleetCrown — before/after, measured defects,
   accept/decline. This is the artifact that decides whether any of it sells.
3. Walk **one** real prospect through the whole chain by hand, with no pipeline
   and no OrangeCat offer at all. Sell a website.
4. Only then offer the profile to a business that already said yes.
5. Only then give FleetCrown a prospect table, and only the states step 3 proved
   exist.

Steps 1 and 2 are independent. The ingest endpoint here is not on the critical
path any more and can wait for step 4. Step 5 is the one to resist starting
early: a pipeline built before a single sale encodes guesses that a real
conversation will contradict.

## Alternatives Considered

**Make the OrangeCat profile mandatory** — the original decision here. Rejected:
it requires a stranger to understand a Bitcoin-native economic layer before they
can accept a website, and it makes an unsolicited pitch look like an account
signup, which is what unsolicited pitches usually are.

**Lead with Solon for member-run organisations.** Rejected for first contact: it
is the most abstract product in the stack. It is a genuine second conversation
with a Verein that already said yes.

**All of it in FleetCrown.** Rejected: it puts a second definition of a fundable
entity next to a CRM, and moves the pre-claim funding invariant from a structural
guarantee to a rule someone has to keep remembering.

**All of it here.** Rejected: prospect tracking is not an economic primitive, and
FleetCrown already has the pipeline shape. This repo would grow a CRM.

**Skip `sitekit`; let the generator write components.** Rejected: it makes output
quality unverifiable per site and unimprovable across sites, which is the whole
point of doing this at volume.

**Pre-create real `profiles` rows for prospects.** Rejected, and impossible
anyway — `profiles.id` is a validated FK to `auth.users(id)`. The constraint is
doing exactly its job.
