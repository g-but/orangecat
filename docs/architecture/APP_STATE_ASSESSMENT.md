   - **No thread context** - Can't see full conversation thread easily

2. **X-Like Experience Gaps**
   - **Post layout** - Not as clean/minimal as X
   - **Thread visualization** - Missing visual thread lines/connections
   - **Quote threading** - Can quote repost but not quote reply in threads
   - **Thread navigation** - No easy way to follow conversation threads
   - **Real-time thread updates** - Limited real-time updates for thread activity

3. **Potential Database Issues**
   - Some migrations may not be applied (see `URGENT_DATABASE_MIGRATION_NEEDED.md`)
   - Duplicate post issues were addressed but may need verification

### 📊 Timeline System Health: **70%** ⚠️

**Verdict**: Timeline works but needs significant improvements for X-like threaded experience.

---

## Threading System Analysis

### Current Threading Capabilities

1. **Comment Threading** ✅
   - Basic parent-child relationship (`parent_comment_id`)
   - Can reply to comments
   - Can load replies to comments
   - **Limitation**: Flat display, no visual thread structure

2. **Post Threading** ❌
   - **Missing**: X-style quote replies that create threads
   - **Missing**: Thread visualization (connecting lines, indentation)
   - **Missing**: Thread context (showing parent posts in thread)
   - **Missing**: Thread navigation (following conversation flow)

3. **Quote Reposts** ⚠️
   - Can quote repost (create new post with original embedded)
   - **Not the same as threading**: Quote reposts are separate posts, not threaded replies

### What's Needed for X-Like Threading

1. **Quote Replies** (Not Quote Reposts)
   - Reply to a post with quote embedded
   - Creates thread relationship (`parent_post_id`)
   - Shows in thread context, not as separate post

2. **Thread Visualization**
   - Visual thread lines connecting posts
   - Indentation for nested replies
   - Thread depth indicators
   - Collapsible thread branches

3. **Thread Navigation**
   - "Show thread" button to see full conversation
   - Thread context view (all posts in thread)
   - Thread timeline (chronological thread view)
   - Thread participants list

4. **Thread Discovery**
   - Threaded conversations in timeline
   - Thread indicators on posts
   - Thread activity notifications
   - Thread search/filter

## Technical Debt & Blockers

### Database Migrations

- Some timeline migrations may need verification
- Check `supabase/migrations/` for unapplied migrations
- Verify `timeline_likes`, `timeline_comments` tables exist

### Code Organization

- Timeline code is well-organized but could benefit from threading-specific modules
- Consider `src/components/timeline/threading/` directory
- Consider `src/services/timeline/threading.ts` service

### Performance

- Thread loading may need optimization (nested queries)
- Consider caching thread structures
- Consider lazy loading thread branches
