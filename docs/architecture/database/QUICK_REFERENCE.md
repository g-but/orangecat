## ⚡ Common Commands

### Check Table Sizes
```sql
SELECT

  tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```

  query,
  state
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state != 'idle'
  AND now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start > interval '5 seconds'
ORDER BY duration DESC;
```

### Check Active Connections

## 🔍 Verification Queries

### After Migration #1 (Index)
```sql
-- Verify index exists
SELECT * FROM pg_indexes
WHERE indexname = 'idx_transactions_status';

-- Test index is used
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM transactions
WHERE status = 'pending'
LIMIT 10;
-- Look for: "Index Scan using idx_transactions_status"
```

### After Migration #2 (Audit Logs)
```sql
-- Verify table exists
SELECT count(*) FROM audit_logs;

-- Verify function exists
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'create_audit_log';

-- Test audit logging
UPDATE profiles SET bio = 'Test' WHERE id = auth.uid();
SELECT * FROM audit_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

## 📊 Monitoring Queries

### Index Health
```sql
SELECT
  indexname,
  idx_scan as times_used,
  idx_tup_read as rows_read,
  idx_tup_fetch as rows_fetched,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) as size
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

### Table Bloat
```sql
SELECT
  tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as total_size,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as table_size,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) -
                 pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as indexes_size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```

### Audit Log Volume (After Migration #2)
```sql
SELECT
  date_trunc('day', created_at) as day,
  count(*) as logs_created,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE severity = 'critical') as critical_count
FROM audit_logs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day DESC;
```

## 🛠️ Useful Functions

### Create Manual Audit Log (After Migration #2)
```sql
SELECT create_audit_log(
  p_user_id := auth.uid(),
  p_action := 'update',
  p_table_name := 'your_table',
  p_record_id := 'record-uuid',
  p_metadata := '{"reason": "manual change"}'::jsonb,
  p_severity := 'info'
);
```

### Increment Profile Views
```sql
SELECT increment_profile_views('profile-uuid');
```

### Update Follow Counts (Automatic via Trigger)
```sql
-- Automatically maintained when follows are added/removed
INSERT INTO follows (follower_id, following_id)
VALUES ('user-a-id', 'user-b-id');
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
```sql
-- Check if you can connect
SELECT current_database(), current_user, version();
```

### Permission Issues
```sql
-- Check your role
SELECT current_user, session_user;

-- Check RLS status
SELECT
  tablename,
  rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

### Migration Failed
```sql
-- Check what migrations were applied
SELECT * FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations
ORDER BY version DESC;

-- Rollback transaction (if still open)
ROLLBACK;
```

## 📈 Performance Baselines

### Current (Before Improvements)
```
transactions table:
- Status filter query: ~500ms (seq scan)
- No audit trail
```

### Target (After Improvements)
```
transactions table:
- Status filter query: ~50ms (index scan) ✨ 10x faster
- Complete audit trail ✅
- Compliance ready ✅
```

## 🎯 Quick Deployment Checklist

Before applying any migration:

- [ ] Read migration file
- [ ] Understand what it does
- [ ] Check if it's idempotent (IF NOT EXISTS)
- [ ] Have rollback plan ready
- [ ] Test in staging (if available)
- [ ] Apply during low traffic
- [ ] Verify after applying
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always wrap in transactions**
   ```sql
   BEGIN;
   -- your changes
   COMMIT;  -- or ROLLBACK if something wrong
   ```

2. **Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE**
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT ...
   ```

3. **Check execution plans**
   - Look for "Seq Scan" (bad for large tables)
   - Look for "Index Scan" (good!)
   - Look for execution time

4. **Monitor index usage**
   - Unused indexes waste space and slow writes
   - Check pg_stat_user_indexes regularly

5. **Keep audit logs trimmed**
   - Archive old logs (>1 year)
   - Vacuum regularly
   - Monitor table size
