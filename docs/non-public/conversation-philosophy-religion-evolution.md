## Raw Conversation Transcript

After death You will just stop existing and that's it. - And the soul and all that is... - I don't think it's more painful. which is always present. - Two, not two. - I think when people say "soul" they mean this part of us that is a part of God. The soul is something else. What does the soul have? Like a real you, who after death either goes to hell or Right. You, who don't have Uh... physical restrictions For example, if you are now The disabled person is weak-headed. So... After death... I don't even know how they explain it. You will be like... with myself, but at the same time You will be a little different. There is no specific description. You are transparent, you fly. Everything is said there as if it was abolished. What exactly is said there? Oh, you're welcome. You need to open it and read it, because I don't remember it anymore. Like, real you. The fact that you live now is like I am temporary. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - I have this concept in my world too. Look, if there is a God, So... In fact, everything in the Bible It's all true. or it simply doesn't exist and we just It all happened thanks to luck. that a comet flew by, uh - and two other elements which without which life is impossible. Just by chance, one on... - to some extent. - And that's it. It so happened that I fucked a meteorite Dinosaur died. And the rest had to adapt, survive more adapted. - Our ancestors divided into two branches. Some went down from the trees, They started to develop the brain. And the second ones remained empty. Thank you, Mark. - A lot of different evolutions have happened. - of the first reasonable person And that's it. I just don't understand what you think. If God exists, then you either believe in it, "Ch-tish" Jesus, well, depending on what God you worship, what you believe in, although In general, he must be alone. Or it simply does not exist. - It doesn't exist. or he is doing it. Or is it different? That is, God is either the absolute infinity of everything, or absolute absence of everything. Look, different people... - No. What was Another question that religion asks Yeah. How did it all happen? How did they create us? Religion tries to find answers to certain questions. Uh, Historically, it appeared. People could not, there was no science, there was no knowledge. The knowledge base of people was very low. And they asked the question: "Ok, why do we need to do this?" And they have two heads. ... Christianity appeared, and they say that It's just... I don't know. This is nature that God created. They don't really say who God is. In some time. Look, according to them, he always existed. Da. Oh my god. He is everything, he is the first, he is the next, he is the... how to say... a bunch of things, he is the knower, and blah blah blah. It's like I am the highest being We don't know what it looks like, its shape. I think it's random If we think that it defines our life, because religion is about... Look, if... Christianity is a lie? And the rest is fiction. And we just... I call myself so. And that's it. Most of them didn't speak. The fact that Our life has no sense, just no sense at all. We were just lucky We are lucky plus or minus to realize yourself Think and that's it. Ooh. And humanity just started to think that there is a God, There is a universe, 100% created. 100% we don't live just like that, that after death there is something too. There are two or three births, many things that are said. and Few people say that It makes no sense. I think that That covers all. A comet flew by, we got a certain IT. chemical elements The first one was... I don't remember the name of it. What happened to the whole thing? We have a pleasant atmosphere. It's not +200 000 degrees, it's -200. Uh... We believe It was very close to the... not very far from... Well, not at first, the temperature was still... You know how we all like I'm telling you, everything is constantly changing. We are a unit in time. We are in a certain time and space of the Universe. - - It will be very hot, we will hide. Let's try to fly to other planets. - Will we make it? That's another question. I think we will make it, become a multi-planetary world. and to build around us some kind of atmosphere where we can live. But at some point, we probably won't be able to 100% because After some time I can tell you for sure, they are just coming closer to the galaxy and... Good night. some fucking explosion E and create something completely new. I think Humanity is... News. ...for this time... Not that he won't make it, just... We are too... He's a V-man. We live very little. - um *Mumbling* It's very difficult. create some kind of life we still won't be able to get very far. Sooner or later, even this... The star that appears to us, she just, well, will take everything that is near. At some point, I think we can make our consciousness exist independently of our body. And then we can actually create such... I would like to be born in 100 years. Yes, perhaps technology is so progressive. - If what they want to do now is what they want to do, you know, like... Who? Elon Musk? Or someone else who wants to change the system to Orbit? because of the cooling Secondly, because there are a lot of people - I need fucking energy, fucking... Like water? Or something like that. - Break. to some place - Sarakabo? Or maybe not. Yeah. like some kind of a station, put an orbit there And thanks to AI we will to progress even faster. I would like to be born in 200-300 years. When these people will be fucked. Well, yes. Well, that you can prolong life. Yes, even if we compare our life now with what it was 100 years ago. But so could just boss to a That's a story. And imagine, by the time you turn 20, the progress will be even more tremendous. 100 years ago we even Previously, the progress was slow. The difference between 50,000 years ago and 40,000 years ago is small. And 40,000 years ago people didn't wipe their asses. 50 years ago - or something else Hi. The difference was small, and now the difference between the king 200 years ago and you In terms of consumption ...socially in your favor. The king had no fucking way. He didn't have the opportunity, for example, so that his dick starts working again. I'll tell you about that. So you live a longer life, you have much more - to healthcare, to technology, to entertainment, 200 years ago you didn't have the opportunity to go to the theater, to watch movies, Listen to music. to go outside freely. And now there is. The world is changing much faster than 50,000 years ago and 40,000 years ago. I would like to find a time when Could you at least How to save knowledge? That's the question. When you can to keep consciousness, that is, now you can, for example, replace the knee, replace the I can tell you for sure. It's just that the system can live for a long time and it's a very difficult operation. You can even live without it. They take a special electronic one. But people can't live there before a certain amount of time, I don't remember, more than 30 years, they Roger, we're ready. But even now, Give a note, I doubt it. technologies we can We don't die from diseases that often anymore. I think in 40 years already things like cancer there will be no problems at all. If in the most terrible place and in the most terrible degree What? Maybe this is We won't be able to treat it, but I think everything else... Peace. There will be a strong gap. Robots... At some point there will be robots The C. Ziamlo. ...a much larger proportion than people. Because now there are no children. - *stutters* These Mahmoods have never heard of a family of four children. But they don't have much to do. Yes, except to absorb knowledge. Yes, very often their existence pay for the state Alibaba! They are so poor that their life level will not change anyway. They can all be poor and two people. They have no prospects. They will have a hard time anyway, most likely. Yeah. They don't know anything else. And they will dance. They have money and all the possibilities. Let's go. I should be straight. They were born at home, and they will be born here. I'm going to put the meat in the pot. Now the government supports it all. If they supported each other, so that the state does not fall. for every new child, the table is set. But if they already have a community there, - I wonder why there is no ...a very poor country, where mostly only white people. Not even that... - several countries where mostly it's white. Very poor, very poor. Look, the poorest white country is Moldova. And Ukraine too. Now Ukraine. Honestly, even 5 years ago Maldonabra. Good job, buddy. Maybe 20 years ago Moldova was worse, but now it's not worse. Because earlier they said "you're a Moldovan" as if it was but now Moldova I think it's even better. - Namaskar. But probably the salaries there are higher than in Ukraine. But in general, the development of Ukraine, for example, if you compare Kishinev and Kiev, I compare such countries as - But India is not all of them. I look... Yes, yes, yes. About white countries, from white countries the most shitty... In terms of income, it is Ukraine and Moldova. - Why is there no other poor thing? Look at this. One blood bash. - India. I don't remember the city where... Two people are burning on the street. Yes, in Varanasi. And then what else? Africa, well, there are just some... There is a certain America, but not all of it. Africa is a normal country. They have water. Hey, Lisa. Bye. Not even a certain one, but for some countries There is a... Good luck, Ash. If you are a woman with a dick, then... There is no shadow. Let's look at it. Poor thing, why is he going to the hospital? very poor white people who are being robbed of their lives *whisper* At least in such moments. He blocked the cat on you. Of course, there is a certain place where really rich people live. I'm going to go get some There is a completely different one. Ciai stranyi! Well, yes. People are living here, it's like... The logic is terrible. Locked in on lockdown will be James Millard in the mix for the next two hours. What's going on? We started the show with a little blue chalk. - Very poor. Very much. But all of Africa is poor. Africa is the most prosperous country. What is it called? Botswana. Eww. But so I Well, there is democracy, it is quite safe there. More or less, they say. I don't know when I wasn't there. There is still... Namibia is also more or less Okay. South Africa is fucked now. of Zimbabwe is fucked up now. Not to mention all the Congo. In South Sudan, there's a war going on. In Eritrea, 97% of girls have They are cut off their genitalia, they can't even breathe. where 67% of the people, as far as I know, I may be mistaken, have an open sewer. That is, they go from the river to the canal. Yeah, I'm a good Shabazzan. I'm a good Rugeetza. Well, now name at least one such country where white people live. Yeah. There is no such country. - I wonder why? Cutie. No. When people live in such conditions, when you need to survive, Thank you. when it's cold, when Nature is not the most... Look at You need to survive. Look, I'm not 70% sure about this. Look, you need to survive, you think? Look, you're a police officer. It's fucking cold in winter. There are no showers. Chakrasiom No. But, f**k, what is it? - Well, that's it. It's cold in winter here. as it was before and now I'll be in that. ... the country, but at the same time there is no resources. But Ukraine. I wouldn't say that people survived there. There is a good black hole. Whaaaaat? Katya? *music* - Are you connected to the cold? Not only because of the cold, because, for example, look, usually the northern countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Canada is a different place. - Those who are in the north These Scandinavians, Usually they are combined by high level of trust, high level of cooperation. and at the same time a high level of respect for individual freedom and They can cooperate well and they can communicate well and negotiate together some projects. They trust each other and they are free. Those who live in other conditions, closer to the equator, A buff would get. They don't have that. These qualities didn't develop. Because I even want to see Argentina. team The country is white, but it is yellow. But it is still in a smaller size than *Badass music* Dubai is the name of Africa. *Mumbling* There is a fucking awesome part of Brazil, but there is a very fucking awesome part of... But where is the fucking awesome part? In Florianapolis, these white parts where... less crime rate People have higher incomes, society functions better. And if you are in black on 7? - - Very easy, just need to... No, I'll tell you how. No. No, I understand. No. But if Look, again, what is the definition of a racist? A racist can be a person who hates the other person. but it's a nightmare. You can't do that. You can't hate other people, wish them to die, wish them to die. Yes, ma'am. We need to wish them good health, we need to treat them with love and respect. Yeah. People are fucking crazy They can't do anything, they can't... to be effective, of course, you need to help, but at least you need to look - It's biology! If it's culture, how can we improve their culture so that they have more trust in each other, more care for each other, more... respect for each other, freedom for each other. because such a model works It's one thing, and another if they don't have money How to make money flow to their development, rather than to steal all the filmatura? and all sorts of local dictators received people and people could pay their bills - So it turns out that black people - - Uh, their development It so happened that it helped me develop Balshoy. and care for each other. and respect for freedom and individuality. In Africa, there is no such thing anywhere. The closest is Botswana. There, it's not so good. I'm just comparing. And the other people who say that even this conversation we have here is already racism. Because we allow Well, a person can biologically have another Other qualities can develop. and to transfer genetically to each other. Yeah. People can genetically have more of a similarity Yeah. I'm more inclined to the behavior that is adventurous than I'm just saying, name 10 countries where people live in the most white, and 10 countries where people live in black or dark. There is a huge difference in the level of life. You can go further. For example, in America there are black and white regions. You will not find any white region where there is absolutely wild. - There are some trailer parks where there are drug addicts, amphetamine addicts, But it's not harmless. ...get into each other's trailer, fuck each other, shoot each other. It's possible. They can steal, they can steal a shooter. It's possible, it happens. But there is no such thing as a fucking... The horror that is in the ghetto in the black. They really shoot each other, there are gangs, they are in gangs. It's scary to walk next to it. And not only this. How many percent of white people are in the population? In the whole country, 13% of blacks are black. And how many... 70 something... There are 70 something white... And the rest is... what is it? 60 something? No. - Is that Googly? Pestilence How much does Aflamecans make? 70% or 60%? When the population is 13 or... how many did you say? 50? 70% commit crimes in America and 60% are black people. при том, что их 13% Well, not 12, but a little more than less, it doesn't matter. Yes, I'm telling you, they just have nature. They have such genes that they have more Impulsiveness. Ah, Rasmus. They are physically different, they run faster, there is no white line. The Olympics are the most popular. as well as there is no *inaudible* which takes only the first place of the black fin. And then if you look at, for example, Well, the amount of... It's a talent for the soul of the population. If you look at the winners of the Olympics in mathematics, physics, Robotics Aye. Thank you. India will look at the Indian market, there are already many Indians. Well, yes. And it will be nice to have many Hindus. I a lot will be Get out By the way, do you know that in China it's divided into two parts? Um, There are some who live normally, well, that is, like... - Second, people live like f*cks. Yes. Yes, there is. If not even... So they get on a bus and they start to talk about why they came here and so on. He doesn't know what's happening. - *Badass music* ♪♪ ♪♪ No, no, thank you. I have to go to work soon. Love 'em. - You can take it from yourself. Okay. I will do it later too. Come on.
