# Buying on OrangeCat as a machine

OrangeCat entities — products, services, projects, causes — are payable by
any client that can speak HTTP and pay a Lightning invoice. No browser, no
account requirement, no scraping. This page is the whole loop.

**Base URL**: `https://orangecat.ch/api/v1` · **Spec**: `GET /api/v1/openapi.json`
(live OpenAPI 3.1, generated from the server's own validation schemas) ·
**Discovery**: `GET /api/v1`

## Auth: two modes

1. **Integration key** — minted by a user at Settings → Integrations. Send
   `X-OrangeCat-Key: ock_…` (or `Authorization: Bearer ock_…`). The key is
   bound to one actor and carries scopes; payments need `payments.write` /
   `payments.read` (or the `*` wildcard). Payments are attributed to the
   key's user as buyer.
2. **No auth at all** — the `/payments/public` flow. Anonymous, IP
   rate-limited, settlement verified via a per-payment bearer token.

## The loop

### 1. Discover

```bash
# Semantic search across public entities (no auth)
curl 'https://orangecat.ch/api/v1/search?q=handmade+ceramics&limit=5'

# Or list a specific entity type
curl 'https://orangecat.ch/api/v1/products?limit=20'
```

### 2. Quote

```bash
curl 'https://orangecat.ch/api/v1/products/<entity_id>'
# → price_btc, title, description — decide whether to buy
```

### 3. Pay

With a key (attributed purchase / contribution):

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://orangecat.ch/api/v1/payments' \
  -H 'X-OrangeCat-Key: ock_…' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"entity_type": "product", "entity_id": "<entity_id>"}'
# → { payment_intent: { id, bolt11, status: "invoice_ready", … }, qr_data, expires_in_seconds }
```

Without an account:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://orangecat.ch/api/v1/payments/public' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"entity_type": "project", "entity_id": "<entity_id>", "amount_btc": 0.0002}'
# → additionally returns status_token — keep it, it is the only credential
```

Pay the returned `bolt11` with any Lightning wallet (NWC `pay_invoice`,
LND, CLN, an exchange withdrawal — anything that pays bolt11).

Contribution-pattern entities (project, cause, …) require `amount_btc`;
fixed-price entities (product, service) take the listed price and ignore it.

### 4. Verify

```bash
# Key flow
curl 'https://orangecat.ch/api/v1/payments/<intent_id>' \
  -H 'X-OrangeCat-Key: ock_…'

# Account-less flow
curl 'https://orangecat.ch/api/v1/payments/public/<intent_id>' \
  -H 'X-Payment-Token: <status_token>'
```

Poll until `status` is terminal. **`paid` means settled** — the server
re-checks the invoice against the receiving wallet (NWC lookup / LNURL
verify) on every read; it is not a client claim. `expired` / `failed` are
the give-up states. Respect `expires_in_seconds` from step 3 — invoices are
not payable forever.

Sellers can also subscribe to the `payment.settled` webhook instead of
polling (Settings → Integrations → Webhooks).

## Paying inline (HTTP 402)

If your agent already speaks the 402 convention (L402-style), you can skip
accounts, keys, and our JSON dialect entirely — one URL does the whole loop:

```bash
# 1. Ask for the thing. No auth. You get 402 + a Lightning challenge.
curl -i "https://orangecat.ch/api/v1/pay/product/<entity-id>?amount_btc=0.0001"
# → HTTP/2 402
# → WWW-Authenticate: L402 token="<intent-id>.<status-token>", invoice="lnbc…"
# → { "error": { "code": "PAYMENT_REQUIRED", "details": { "token": "…", "bolt11": "lnbc…", … } } }

# 2. Pay the bolt11 with any Lightning wallet. Keep the preimage.

# 3. Repeat the GET with proof. The preimage is verified cryptographically
#    against the invoice's payment_hash — no polling needed.
curl "https://orangecat.ch/api/v1/pay/product/<entity-id>" \
  -H 'Authorization: L402 <token>:<preimage>'
# → { "success": true, "data": { "status": "paid", "verified_by": "preimage", … } }
```

`verified_by` is `preimage` when the cryptographic proof checked out, or
`settlement` when we fell back to observed settlement (on-chain has no
preimage). Not paid yet → 402 again (your original invoice still stands —
respect its expiry). Challenge creation is rate limited per IP.

## Rules of the road

- **Idempotency**: entity-create endpoints accept an `Idempotency-Key`
  header. Payment creation does not yet — treat a timeout as unknown and
  reconcile via status polling, don't blind-retry the POST.
- **Rate limits**: per key for authenticated calls, per IP for the public
  flow. Back off on 429 using the `Retry-After` header.
- **Sandbox**: keys minted with the test flag (`ock_test_…`) create
  sandbox-flagged entities; live payment flows use live keys.
- **Conventions** (error envelope, versioning): see
  [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md).
