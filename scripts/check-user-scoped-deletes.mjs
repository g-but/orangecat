/**
 * check-user-scoped-deletes.mjs — every DELETE on a per-user Cat table names
 * the user.
 *
 * Cat's memory tables hold one row per user with no other tenancy boundary in
 * the query itself. Six deletes in `src/services/cat/memory.ts` remove rows;
 * four already filtered on `user_id`, and the two PRUNE paths did not — they
 * deleted purely by `id`, on ids fetched moments earlier by a user-scoped
 * query.
 *
 * That was safe, and only conditionally: the ids were right, and the client was
 * RLS-scoped. Neither is guaranteed by the code that does the deleting. Three
 * other paths in this service already use `getAdminClient()`, where RLS is not
 * a backstop at all — hand one of those to a prune and it deletes across users,
 * silently, from a function whose job is routine cleanup nobody watches.
 *
 * The second instance is the reason this gate exists rather than a third fix:
 * `recordForgottenFacts` says "same pattern as memory pruning" in its own
 * comment, and inherited the gap along with the pattern. bitbaum/orangecat#563
 * finding 13.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow: it checks the Cat memory service, where the invariant is
 * uniform and the tables are strictly per-user. Widening it to every table in
 * the app would need a per-table notion of ownership that does not exist yet,
 * and a gate that has to guess is a gate that gets muted.
