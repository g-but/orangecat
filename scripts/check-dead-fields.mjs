/**
 * check-dead-fields.mjs — dead-field ratchet.
 *
 * A "dead field" is a field a user can fill in that no page ever shows back:
 * declared in a Zod schema under src/lib/validation/, carried through the domain
 * and API layers, stored in Postgres — and referenced by no component and no
 * page. The data is collected and then silently swallowed.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical. Two shipped instances:
 *
 *   - `portfolio_links` (fixed 2026-08-24): users pasted their portfolio URLs
 *     into the service form and no page rendered them.
 *   - the loan refinance block (fixed 2026-08-25): a borrower states their
 *     CURRENT rate and their DESIRED rate — the two numbers that define a
 *     refinance — and the public loan page rendered neither, while rendering
 *     `monthly_payment` from the same form section. Half-rendering is what made
 *     it invisible: the section looked complete.
 *
 * Fixing the second instance is where the Never-Twice rule says to stop fixing
 * and start automating, so: this gate. It FAILS when a schema field is dead and
 * not listed in KNOWN_DEAD below. The baseline is a one-way ratchet — entries
 * come out when a field starts rendering, and nothing goes in without a written
 * reason on the line.
 *
 * Deliberate scope: the "rendered" surface is src/components/** and src/app/**
 * minus src/app/api/**. Domain services, API routes and generated types do not
 * count as rendering — passing a value along is not showing it to anyone. Entity
 * form configs do not count either: an input the user types into is the source
 * of the problem, not evidence against it.
 *
 * Run: npm run check:dead-fields   (part of `npm run verify`; exit 1 on FAIL)
 *      node scripts/check-dead-fields.mjs --list   (print current dead fields)

/**
 * Fields that are currently not rendered, each with the reason it is allowed.
 * This list is a one-way ratchet: it may shrink freely, and an entry must not be
 * added without a reason written on the line. When a field starts rendering, the
 * check FAILS until its entry is deleted — that is how a gain gets locked in.
 *
 * The third group is debt, not absolution. Those fields are content a reader
 * would want and no page shows; they are listed so the gate can hold the line at
 * today's count instead of being deleted for being noisy. Shrink it.
 *
 * Baseline history:
 *   42 (2026-08-25) — established. Measured 48 before the same commit rendered
 *                     the loan refinance terms and the event venue address,
 *                     online join link, RSVP deadline and all-day flag. Those
 *                     six came off by being fixed, not by being excused.

  // These three are properties of `recurrencePatternSchema`, i.e. they live
  // INSIDE the `recurrence_pattern` JSONB column — they are not columns of their
  // own. `recurrence_pattern` IS rendered (event.tsx → formatRecurrence), which
  // displays all three, so they are not dead.
  //
  // Two scanner limits meet here, and both are deliberate to leave alone:
  //   1. The field regex reads every schema property as top-level, so a nested
  //      sub-schema's members look like columns.
  //   2. Only src/components and src/app count as render surfaces, and the
  //      formatter is a pure helper in src/lib — correctly, by separation of
  //      concerns. Widening the scan to src/lib would let non-render code vouch
  //      for a field and mask genuinely dead ones, which is exactly the mistake
  //      that create-templates caused on this checker's first run.
  // Fixing this properly means teaching the scanner that `X: someSubSchema`
  // makes X the parent of that schema's members. Worth doing when a second
  // nested schema appears; one instance does not justify the machinery.
