#
# Merge every open PR that is ready and fully green, then re-arm CI on main.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Nobody reviews PRs on this repo — the owner explicitly does not want to be in
# the merge loop, and agent sessions are barred from merging by hand. So the
# policy lives here, in the repo, where it is visible, revocable, and applies
# uniformly to every PR instead of depending on who opened it.
#
# THE POLICY
#   merge a PR  <=>  it is not a draft
#                    AND carries no hold label
#                    AND has at least one check
#                    AND every check has finished green
#                    AND GitHub reports it cleanly mergeable
#
# Anything else is left alone for the next sweep. Nothing here forces a merge:
# a red or pending PR simply waits, and a draft waits forever. To hold a ready
# PR back, mark it a draft or add one of the hold labels below.
#
# ONE PR PER SWEEP, AND ONLY ONTO A GREEN MAIN
# --------------------------------------------
# A PR's checks prove *that PR against the main it branched from* — not against
# the other eleven PRs sitting next to it. Merging a batch in one pass would put
# a combination onto main that nothing ever built. So this script merges at most
# one PR, then hands control back to CI: the merge train advances one car per
# sweep, and every car is verified on main before the next one couples.
#
# For the same reason it refuses to merge while main's CI is red or still
# running. Red main => stop adding changes until it is fixed; running CI => the
# answer is not in yet. Both simply defer to the next sweep.
#
# THE CD RE-ARM (do not remove)
#   A push made with the default GITHUB_TOKEN does NOT trigger workflows. CI
#   runs on push-to-main and CD chains off CI, so a merge from this script would
#   otherwise land on main and never deploy. The explicit workflow_dispatch of
#   CI at the end restores that chain: CI runs on main -> CD fires -> box gets
#   the new build. Silent no-deploy is the failure mode this guards against.
