# Dispatch CD on main, and prove it actually started.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# CD triggers on `workflow_run` of CI. GitHub does not emit that event when the
# CI run was itself created with the default GITHUB_TOKEN — which is exactly how
# the auto-merge sweep re-arms CI after every bot merge. The chain therefore
# breaks precisely on the automated path, and breaks *silently*: CI is green, no
# check is red, and nothing deploys. On 2026-08-04 that stranded 14 verified
# commits on main for eight hours while the box kept serving the old build.
#
# So the dispatched run hands off explicitly instead of relying on the event.
#
# A dispatch that quietly creates no run is the same silent failure one level
# down, so it is verified rather than assumed. If no run appears, exit non-zero:
# CI goes red on main, which halts the merge train (auto-merge refuses a broken
# base) and files the red-main issue. Stopping is the correct response to "we
# can no longer ship" — piling up more unshippable merges is not.
