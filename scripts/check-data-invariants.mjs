/**
 * Nightly DATA-INVARIANT gate — assert against the rows production actually
 * holds, not the rows the unit tests imagine.
 *
 * Every test in this repo runs against mocks. That is why the shared-wallet
 * disclosure shipped wrong three times on 2026-08-02 with a fully green suite:
 * the mocks encoded the data shape we assumed (one address per wallet row,
 * links that point at live entities), and production held a different one
 * (the same address across 2–11 wallet rows, 8 of 10 links pointing at deleted
 * entities). No amount of unit testing finds that class — only reading prod
 * does. This runs the reading on a schedule.
 *
 * Each invariant is a claim the product makes to users. A violation means we
 * are showing someone something false about their money.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-data-invariants.mjs           # report, always exit 0
 *   node scripts/check-data-invariants.mjs --gate    # exit 1 on any violation
 *
 * Env: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL / SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
 * (.env.local fallback for local runs, EnvironmentFile on the box).
