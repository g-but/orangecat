## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of OrangeCat seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

**How to Report:**

### Option 1: GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)
Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:
1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/g-but/orangecat/security)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the private advisory form

### Option 2: Direct Contact
If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, please contact:
- **Security Email:** [Create a private GitHub security advisory instead of emailing]
- For urgent issues, you may open a **draft security advisory** which notifies maintainers privately

**IMPORTANT:**
- ❌ **Do NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- ❌ **Do NOT** disclose publicly until we've released a fix
- ✅ **DO** use private channels only

**What to Include:**
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Affected versions
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

## Response Time

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Detailed Update:** Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline:** As soon as possible based on severity
